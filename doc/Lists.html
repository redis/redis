It's possible to add elements to a Redis List pushing new elements on the head (on the left) or on the tail (on the right) of the list.<br/><br/>The <a href="RpushCommand.html">LPUSH</a> command inserts a new elmenet on head, while <a href="RpushCommand.html">RPUSH</a> inserts a new element on tail. A new list is created when one of this operations is performed against an empty key.<br/><br/>For instance if perform the following operations:
<pre class="codeblock python" name="code">
LPUSH mylist a   # now the list is &quot;a&quot;
LPUSH mylist b   # now the list is &quot;b&quot;,&quot;a&quot;
RPUSH mylist c   # now the list is &quot;b&quot;,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;c&quot; (RPUSH was used this time)
</pre>
The resulting list stored at <i>mylist</i> will contain the elements &quot;b&quot;,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;c&quot;.<br/><br/>The max length of a list is 232-1 elements (4294967295, more than 4 billion of elements per list).<h1><a name="Implementation details">Implementation details</a></h1>Redis Lists are implemented as doubly liked lists. A few commands benefit from the fact the lists are doubly linked in order to reach the needed element starting from the nearest extreme (head or tail). <a href="LrangeCommand.html">LRANGE</a> and <a href="LindexCommand.html">LINDEX</a> are examples of such commands.<br/><br/>The use of linked lists also guarantees that regardless of the length of the list pushing and popping are O(1) operations.<br/><br/>Redis Lists cache length information so <a href="LlenCommand.html">LLEN</a> is O(1) as well.
