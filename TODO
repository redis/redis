BEFORE REDIS 1.0.0-rc1

- What happens if the saving child gets killed instead to end normally? Handle this.
- Make sinterstore / unionstore / sdiffstore returning the cardinality of the resulting set.
- Remove max number of args limit
- GETSET
- network layer stresser in test in demo, make sure to set/get random streams of data and check that what we read back is byte-by-byte the same.
- maxclients directive
- check 'server.dirty' everywere
- replication automated tests
- an external tool able to perform the 'difference' between two Redis servers. It's like 'diff', but against Redis servers, and the output is the set of commands needed to turn the first server into the second, suitable to be sent via netcat.
   $ ./redis-diff 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2 > diff.txt
   $ cat diff.txt | nc 192.168.1.1 6379
   $ ./redis-diff 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2
   $ # No output now the servers are identical

This command should be smart and don't use too much memory, that is, take two connections at the same time against the two servers and perform the comparison key by key. Probably the initial "KEYS *" is unavoidable.

- Shutdown must kill other background savings before to start saving. Otherwise the DB can get replaced by the child that rename(2) after the parent for some reason.
- Add missing commands in documentation
- Document replication
- Objects sharing configuration, add the directive "objectsharingpool <size>"
- Make sure to convert all the fstat() calls to 64bit versions.
- SINTERCOUNT, SUNIONCOUNT, SDIFFCOUNT

FUTURE HINTS

- if in-memory values compression will be implemented, make sure to implement this so that addReply() is able to handle compressed objects, just creating an uncompressed version on the fly and adding this to the output queue instead of the original one. When insetad we need to look at the object string value (SORT BY for example), call a function that will turn the object into an uncompresed one.
