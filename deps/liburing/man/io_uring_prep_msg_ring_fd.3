.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR io_uring_prep_msg_ring_fd (3)
prepares an SQE to send a direct file descriptor to another ring. The submission
queue entry
.I sqe
is setup to use the file descriptor
.IR fd ,
which must identify a target io_uring context, to send the locally registered
file descriptor with value
.I source_fd
to the destination ring into index
.I target_fd
and passing
.I data
as the user data in the target CQE with the request modifier flags set by
.IR flags .
Currently there are no valid flag modifiers, this field must contain
.BR 0 .

.BR io_uring_prep_msg_ring_fd_alloc (3)
is similar to
.BR io_uring_prep_msg_ring_fd (3) ,
but doesn't specify a target index for the direct descriptor. Instead, this
index is allocated in the target ring and returned in the CQE
.IR res
field.

.SH RETURN VALUE
None

.SH ERRORS
These are the errors that are reported in the CQE
.I res
field.
.TP
.B -ENOMEM
The kernel was unable to allocate memory for the request.
.TP
.B -EINVAL
One of the fields set in the SQE was invalid.
.TP
.B -EINVAL
Target ring is identical to the source ring.
.TP
.B -EBADFD
The descriptor passed in
.I fd
does not refer to an io_uring file descriptor, or the ring is in a disabled
state.
.TP
.B -EOVERFLOW
The kernel was unable to fill a CQE on the target ring. This can happen if
the target CQ ring is in an overflow state and the kernel wasn't able to
allocate memory for a new CQE entry.
.TP
.B -ENFILE
The direct descriptor table in the target ring was full, no new descriptors
could be successfully allocated.
