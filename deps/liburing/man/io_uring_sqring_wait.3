.TH io_uring_sqring_wait 3 "January 25, 2022" "liburing-2.1" "liburing Manual"
.SH NAME
io_uring_sqring_wait \- wait for free space in the SQ ring
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <liburing.h>
.PP
.BI "int io_uring_sqring_wait(struct io_uring *" ring ");"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The function
.BR io_uring_sqring_wait (3)
allows the caller to wait for space to free up in the SQ ring belonging to the
.I ring
param, which happens when the kernel side thread
has consumed one or more entries. If the SQ ring is currently non-full,
no action is taken.

This feature can only be used when the ring has been setup with
.B IORING_SETUP_SQPOLL
and hence is using an offloaded approach to request submissions.

.SH RETURN VALUE
On success it returns the free space. If the kernel does not support the
feature, -EINVAL is returned.
