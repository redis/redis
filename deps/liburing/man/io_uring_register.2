.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP

The
.BR io_uring_register (2)
system call registers resources (e.g. user buffers, files, eventfd,
personality, restrictions) for use in an
.BR io_uring (7)
instance referenced by
.IR fd .
Registering files or user buffers allows the kernel to take long term
references to internal data structures or create long term mappings of
application memory, greatly reducing per-I/O overhead.

.I fd
is the file descriptor returned by a call to
.BR io_uring_setup (2).
If
.I opcode
has the flag
.B IORING_REGISTER_USE_REGISTERED_RING
ored into it,
.I fd
is instead the index of a registered ring fd.

.I opcode
can be one of:

.TP
.B IORING_REGISTER_BUFFERS
.I arg
points to a
.I struct iovec
array of
.I nr_args
entries.  The buffers associated with the iovecs will be locked in
memory and charged against the user's
.B RLIMIT_MEMLOCK
resource limit.  See
.BR getrlimit (2)
for more information.  Additionally, there is a size limit of 1GiB per
buffer.  Currently, the buffers must be anonymous, non-file-backed
memory, such as that returned by
.BR malloc (3)
or
.BR mmap (2)
with the
.B MAP_ANONYMOUS
flag set.  It is expected that this limitation will be lifted in the
future. Huge pages are supported as well. Note that the entire huge
page will be pinned in the kernel, even if only a portion of it is
used.

After a successful call, the supplied buffers are mapped into the
kernel and eligible for I/O.  To make use of them, the application
must specify the
.B IORING_OP_READ_FIXED
or
.B IORING_OP_WRITE_FIXED
opcodes in the submission queue entry (see the
.I struct io_uring_sqe
definition in
.BR io_uring_enter (2)),
and set the
.I buf_index
field to the desired buffer index.  The memory range described by the
submission queue entry's
.I addr
and
.I len
fields must fall within the indexed buffer.

It is perfectly valid to setup a large buffer and then only use part
of it for an I/O, as long as the range is within the originally mapped
region.

An application can increase or decrease the size or number of
registered buffers by first unregistering the existing buffers, and
then issuing a new call to
.BR io_uring_register (2)
with the new buffers.

Note that before 5.13 registering buffers would wait for the ring to idle.
If the application currently has requests in-flight, the registration will
wait for those to finish before proceeding.

An application need not unregister buffers explicitly before shutting
down the io_uring instance. Note, however, that shutdown processing may run
asynchronously within the kernel. As a result, it is not guaranteed that
pages are immediately unpinned in this case. Available since 5.1.

.TP
.B IORING_REGISTER_BUFFERS2
Register buffers for I/O. Similar to
.B IORING_REGISTER_BUFFERS
but aims to have a more extensible ABI.

.I arg
points to a
.I struct io_uring_rsrc_register,
and
.I nr_args
should be set to the number of bytes in the structure.

.PP
.in +8n
.EX
struct io_uring_rsrc_register {
    __u32 nr;
    __u32 resv;
    __u64 resv2;
    __aligned_u64 data;
    __aligned_u64 tags;
};

.EE
.in
.PP

.in +8n

The
.I data
field contains a pointer to a
.I struct iovec
array of
.I nr
entries.
The
.I tags
field should either be 0, then tagging is disabled, or point to an array
of
.I nr
"tags" (unsigned 64 bit integers). If a tag is zero, then tagging for this
particular resource (a buffer in this case) is disabled. Otherwise, after the
resource had been unregistered and it's not used anymore, a CQE will be
posted with
.I user_data
set to the specified tag and all other fields zeroed.

Note that resource updates, e.g.
.B IORING_REGISTER_BUFFERS_UPDATE,
don't necessarily deallocate resources by the time it returns, but they might
be held alive until all requests using it complete.

Available since 5.13.

.TP
.B IORING_REGISTER_BUFFERS_UPDATE
Updates registered buffers with new ones, either turning a sparse entry into
a real one, or replacing an existing entry.

.I arg
must contain a pointer to a struct io_uring_rsrc_update2, which contains
an offset on which to start the update, and an array of
.I struct iovec.
.I tags
points to an array of tags.
.I nr
must contain the number of descriptors in the passed in arrays.
See
.B IORING_REGISTER_BUFFERS2
for the resource tagging description.

.PP
.in +8n
.EX

struct io_uring_rsrc_update2 {
    __u32 offset;
    __u32 resv;
    __aligned_u64 data;
    __aligned_u64 tags;
    __u32 nr;
    __u32 resv2;
};
.EE
.in
.PP

.in +8n

Available since 5.13.

.TP
.B IORING_UNREGISTER_BUFFERS
This operation takes no argument, and
.I arg
must be passed as NULL.  All previously registered buffers associated
with the io_uring instance will be released synchronously. Available since 5.1.

.TP
.B IORING_REGISTER_FILES
Register files for I/O.
.I arg
contains a pointer to an array of
.I nr_args
file descriptors (signed 32 bit integers).

To make use of the registered files, the
.B IOSQE_FIXED_FILE
flag must be set in the
.I flags
member of the
.IR "struct io_uring_sqe" ,
and the
.I fd
member is set to the index of the file in the file descriptor array.

The file set may be sparse, meaning that the
.B fd
field in the array may be set to
.B -1.
See
.B IORING_REGISTER_FILES_UPDATE
for how to update files in place.

Note that before 5.13 registering files would wait for the ring to idle.
If the application currently has requests in-flight, the registration will
wait for those to finish before proceeding. See
.B IORING_REGISTER_FILES_UPDATE
for how to update an existing set without that limitation.

Files are automatically unregistered when the io_uring instance is
torn down. An application needs only unregister if it wishes to
register a new set of fds. Available since 5.1.

.TP
.B IORING_REGISTER_FILES2
Register files for I/O. Similar to
.B IORING_REGISTER_FILES.

.I arg
points to a
.I struct io_uring_rsrc_register,
and
.I nr_args
should be set to the number of bytes in the structure.

The
.I data
field contains a pointer to an array of
.I nr
file descriptors (signed 32 bit integers).
.I tags
field should either be 0 or or point to an array of
.I nr
"tags" (unsigned 64 bit integers). See
.B IORING_REGISTER_BUFFERS2
for more info on resource tagging.

Note that resource updates, e.g.
.B IORING_REGISTER_FILES_UPDATE,
don't necessarily deallocate resources, they might be held until all requests
using that resource complete.

Available since 5.13.

.TP
.B IORING_REGISTER_FILES_UPDATE
This operation replaces existing files in the registered file set with new
ones, either turning a sparse entry (one where fd is equal to
.B -1
) into a real one, removing an existing entry (new one is set to
.B -1
), or replacing an existing entry with a new existing entry.

.I arg
must contain a pointer to a
.I struct io_uring_files_update,
which contains
an offset on which to start the update, and an array of file descriptors to
use for the update.
.I nr_args
must contain the number of descriptors in the passed in array. Available
since 5.5.

File descriptors can be skipped if they are set to
.B IORING_REGISTER_FILES_SKIP.
Skipping an fd will not touch the file associated with the previous
fd at that index. Available since 5.12.

.TP
.B IORING_REGISTER_FILES_UPDATE2
Similar to IORING_REGISTER_FILES_UPDATE, replaces existing files in the
registered file set with new ones, either turning a sparse entry (one where
fd is equal to
.B -1
) into a real one, removing an existing entry (new one is set to
.B -1
), or replacing an existing entry with a new existing entry.

.I arg
must contain a pointer to a
.I struct io_uring_rsrc_update2,
which contains
an offset on which to start the update, and an array of file descriptors to
use for the update stored in
.I data.
.I tags
points to an array of tags.
.I nr
must contain the number of descriptors in the passed in arrays.
See
.B IORING_REGISTER_BUFFERS2
for the resource tagging description.

Available since 5.13.

.TP
.B IORING_UNREGISTER_FILES
This operation requires no argument, and
.I arg
must be passed as NULL.  All previously registered files associated
with the io_uring instance will be unregistered. Available since 5.1.

.TP
.B IORING_REGISTER_EVENTFD
It's possible to use eventfd(2) to get notified of completion events on an
io_uring instance. If this is desired, an eventfd file descriptor can be
registered through this operation.
.I arg
must contain a pointer to the eventfd file descriptor, and
.I nr_args
must be 1. Note that while io_uring generally takes care to avoid spurious
events, they can occur. Similarly, batched completions of CQEs may only trigger
a single eventfd notification even if multiple CQEs are posted. The application
should make no assumptions on number of events being available having a direct
correlation to eventfd notifications posted. An eventfd notification must thus
only be treated as a hint to check the CQ ring for completions. Available since
5.2.

An application can temporarily disable notifications, coming through the
registered eventfd, by setting the
.B IORING_CQ_EVENTFD_DISABLED
bit in the
.I flags
field of the CQ ring.
Available since 5.8.

.TP
.B IORING_REGISTER_EVENTFD_ASYNC
This works just like
.B IORING_REGISTER_EVENTFD
, except notifications are only posted for events that complete in an async
manner. This means that events that complete inline while being submitted
do not trigger a notification event. The arguments supplied are the same as
for
.B IORING_REGISTER_EVENTFD.
Available since 5.6.

.TP
.B IORING_UNREGISTER_EVENTFD
Unregister an eventfd file descriptor to stop notifications. Since only one
eventfd descriptor is currently supported, this operation takes no argument,
and
.I arg
must be passed as NULL and
.I nr_args
must be zero. Available since 5.2.

.TP
.B IORING_REGISTER_PROBE
This operation returns a structure, io_uring_probe, which contains information
about the opcodes supported by io_uring on the running kernel.
.I arg
must contain a pointer to a struct io_uring_probe, and
.I nr_args
must contain the size of the ops array in that probe struct. The ops array
is of the type io_uring_probe_op, which holds the value of the opcode and
a flags field. If the flags field has
.B IO_URING_OP_SUPPORTED
set, then this opcode is supported on the running kernel. Available since 5.6.

.TP
.B IORING_REGISTER_PERSONALITY
This operation registers credentials of the running application with io_uring,
and returns an id associated with these credentials. Applications wishing to
share a ring between separate users/processes can pass in this credential id
in the sqe
.B personality
field. If set, that particular sqe will be issued with these credentials. Must
be invoked with
.I arg
set to NULL and
.I nr_args
set to zero. Available since 5.6.

.TP
.B IORING_UNREGISTER_PERSONALITY
This operation unregisters a previously registered personality with io_uring.
.I nr_args
must be set to the id in question, and
.I arg
must be set to NULL. Available since 5.6.

.TP
.B IORING_REGISTER_ENABLE_RINGS
This operation enables an io_uring ring started in a disabled state
.RB (IORING_SETUP_R_DISABLED
was specified in the call to
.BR io_uring_setup (2)).
While the io_uring ring is disabled, submissions are not allowed and
registrations are not restricted.

After the execution of this operation, the io_uring ring is enabled:
submissions and registration are allowed, but they will
be validated following the registered restrictions (if any).
This operation takes no argument, must be invoked with
.I arg
set to NULL and
.I nr_args
set to zero. Available since 5.10.

.TP
.B IORING_REGISTER_RESTRICTIONS
.I arg
points to a
.I struct io_uring_restriction
array of
.I nr_args
entries.

With an entry it is possible to allow an
.BR io_uring_register (2)
.I opcode,
or specify which
.I opcode
and
.I flags
of the submission queue entry are allowed,
or require certain
.I flags
to be specified (these flags must be set on each submission queue entry).

All the restrictions must be submitted with a single
.BR io_uring_register (2)
call and they are handled as an allowlist (opcodes and flags not registered,
are not allowed).

Restrictions can be registered only if the io_uring ring started in a disabled
state
.RB (IORING_SETUP_R_DISABLED
must be specified in the call to
.BR io_uring_setup (2)).

Available since 5.10.

.TP
.B IORING_REGISTER_IOWQ_AFF
By default, async workers created by io_uring will inherit the CPU mask of its
parent. This is usually all the CPUs in the system, unless the parent is being
run with a limited set. If this isn't the desired outcome, the application
may explicitly tell io_uring what CPUs the async workers may run on.
.I arg
must point to a
.B cpu_set_t
mask, and
.I nr_args
the byte size of that mask.

Available since 5.14.

.TP
.B IORING_UNREGISTER_IOWQ_AFF
Undoes a CPU mask previously set with
.B IORING_REGISTER_IOWQ_AFF.
Must not have
.I arg
or
.I nr_args
set.

Available since 5.14.

.TP
.B IORING_REGISTER_IOWQ_MAX_WORKERS
By default, io_uring limits the unbounded workers created to the maximum
processor count set by
.I RLIMIT_NPROC
and the bounded workers is a function of the SQ ring size and the number
of CPUs in the system. Sometimes this can be excessive (or too little, for
bounded), and this command provides a way to change the count per ring (per NUMA
node) instead.

.I arg
must be set to an
.I unsigned int
pointer to an array of two values, with the values in the array being set to
the maximum count of workers per NUMA node. Index 0 holds the bounded worker
count, and index 1 holds the unbounded worker count. On successful return, the
passed in array will contain the previous maximum valyes for each type. If the
count being passed in is 0, then this command returns the current maximum values
and doesn't modify the current setting.
.I nr_args
must be set to 2, as the command takes two values.

Available since 5.15.

.TP
.B IORING_REGISTER_RING_FDS
Whenever
.BR io_uring_enter (2)
is called to submit request or wait for completions, the kernel must grab a
reference to the file descriptor. If the application using io_uring is threaded,
the file table is marked as shared, and the reference grab and put of the file
descriptor count is more expensive than it is for a non-threaded application.

Similarly to how io_uring allows registration of files, this allow registration
of the ring file descriptor itself. This reduces the overhead of the
.BR io_uring_enter (2)
system call.

.I arg
must be set to an unsigned int pointer to an array of type
.I struct io_uring_rsrc_register
of
.I nr_args
number of entries. The
.B data
field of this struct must point to an io_uring file descriptor, and the
.B offset
field can be either
.B -1
or an explicit offset desired for the registered file descriptor value. If
.B -1
is used, then upon successful return of this system call, the field will
contain the value of the registered file descriptor to be used for future
.BR io_uring_enter (2)
system calls.

On successful completion of this request, the returned descriptors may be used
instead of the real file descriptor for
.BR io_uring_enter (2),
provided that
.B IORING_ENTER_REGISTERED_RING
is set in the
.I flags
for the system call. This flag tells the kernel that a registered descriptor
is used rather than a real file descriptor.

Each thread or process using a ring must register the file descriptor directly
by issuing this request.

The maximum number of supported registered ring descriptors is currently
limited to
.B 16.

Available since 5.18.

.TP
.B IORING_UNREGISTER_RING_FDS
Unregister descriptors previously registered with
.B IORING_REGISTER_RING_FDS.

.I arg
must be set to an unsigned int pointer to an array of type
.I struct io_uring_rsrc_register
of
.I nr_args
number of entries. Only the
.B offset
field should be set in the structure, containing the registered file descriptor
offset previously returned from
.B IORING_REGISTER_RING_FDS
that the application wishes to unregister.

Note that this isn't done automatically on ring exit, if the thread or task
that previously registered a ring file descriptor isn't exiting. It is
recommended to manually unregister any previously registered ring descriptors
if the ring is closed and the task persists. This will free up a registration
slot, making it available for future use.

Available since 5.18.

.TP
.B IORING_REGISTER_PBUF_RING
Registers a shared buffer ring to be used with provided buffers. This is a
newer alternative to using
.B IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS
which is more efficient, to be used with request types that support the
.B IOSQE_BUFFER_SELECT
flag.

The
.I arg
argument must be filled in with the appropriate information. It looks as
follows:
.PP
.in +12n
.EX
struct io_uring_buf_reg {
    __u64 ring_addr;
    __u32 ring_entries;
    __u16 bgid;
    __u16 pad;
    __u64 resv[3];
};
.EE
.in
.PP
.in +8n
The
.I ring_addr
field must contain the address to the memory allocated to fit this ring.
The memory must be page aligned and hence allocated appropriately using eg
.BR posix_memalign (3)
or similar. The size of the ring is the product of
.I ring_entries
and the size of
.IR "struct io_uring_buf" .
.I ring_entries
is the desired size of the ring, and must be a power-of-2 in size. The maximum
size allowed is 2^15 (32768).
.I bgid
is the buffer group ID associated with this ring. SQEs that select a buffer
have a buffer group associated with them in their
.I buf_group
field, and the associated CQEs will have
.B IORING_CQE_F_BUFFER
set in their
.I flags
member, which will also contain the specific ID of the buffer selected. The rest
of the fields are reserved and must be cleared to zero.

.I nr_args
must be set to 1.

Also see
.BR io_uring_register_buf_ring (3)
for more details. Available since 5.19.

.TP
.B IORING_UNREGISTER_PBUF_RING
Unregister a previously registered provided buffer ring.
.I arg
must be set to the address of a struct io_uring_buf_reg, with just the
.I bgid
field set to the buffer group ID of the previously registered provided buffer
group.
.I nr_args
must be set to 1. Also see
.B IORING_REGISTER_PBUF_RING .

Available since 5.19.

.TP
.B IORING_REGISTER_SYNC_CANCEL
Performs a synchronous cancelation request, which works in a similar fashion to
.B IORING_OP_ASYNC_CANCEL
except it completes inline. This can be useful for scenarios where cancelations
should happen synchronously, rather than needing to issue an SQE and wait for
completion of that specific CQE.

.I arg
must be set to a pointer to a struct io_uring_sync_cancel_reg structure, with
the details filled in for what request(s) to target for cancelation. See
.BR io_uring_register_sync_cancel (3)
for details on that. The return values are the same, except they are passed
back synchronously rather than through the CQE
.I res
field.
.I nr_args
must be set to 1.

Available since 6.0.

.TP
.B IORING_REGISTER_FILE_ALLOC_RANGE
sets the allowable range for fixed file index allocations within the
kernel. When requests that can instantiate a new fixed file are used with
.B IORING_FILE_INDEX_ALLOC ,
the application is asking the kernel to allocate a new fixed file descriptor
rather than pass in a specific value for one. By default, the kernel will
pick any available fixed file descriptor within the range available.
This effectively allows the application to set aside a range just for dynamic
allocations, with the remainder being used for specific values.

.I nr_args
must be set to 1 and
.I arg
must be set to a pointer to a struct io_uring_file_index_range:
.PP
.in +12n
.EX
struct io_uring_file_index_range {
    __u32 off;
    __u32 len;
    __u64 resv;
};
.EE
.in
.PP
.in +8n
with
.I off
being set to the starting value for the range, and
.I len
being set to the number of descriptors. The reserved
.I resv
field must be cleared to zero.

The application must have registered a file table first.

Available since 6.0.

.SH RETURN VALUE

On success,
.BR io_uring_register (2)
returns either 0 or a positive value, depending on the
.I opcode
used.  On error, a negative error value is returned. The caller should not rely
on the
.I errno
variable.
