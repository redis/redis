* Prerequisites
  
  1. Make sure you have bison (http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) installed in your system. 
  2. Make sure you have ruby installed in your system (required to build).

* Compilation and Installation

  1. Run make in the top directory.

     This command will create the following directories and
     store libraries and binaries files into them.

       * bin
       * lib
       * include

      You can directory invoke 'minirake' as the following.

        $ ruby ./minirake

If an error occurs when compiling mruby, it will be helpful for others if you
send a detailed report to the developers that includes the error log, machine,
and OS type.


* Porting to other platforms


That's all.
