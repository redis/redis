.SH DESCRIPTION
This header file is a collection of functions can be used to populate
the memkind operations structure for memory kinds that use jemalloc.
.PP
.BR memkind_arena_create ()
is an implementation of the memkind "create" operation for memory
kinds that use jemalloc.  This calls
.BR memkind_default_create ()
(see
.BR memkind_default.h (3))
followed by
.BR memkind_arena_create_map ()
described below.
.PP
.BR memkind_arena_create_map ()
creates the
.I arena_map
array for the memkind structure pointed to by
.IR kind
which can be indexed by the
.BR ops.get_arena ()
function from the kind's operations.  If get_arena points
.BR memkind_thread_get_arena ()
then there will be four arenas created for each processor,
and if get_arena points to
.BR memkind_bijective_get_arena ()
then just one arena is created.
.PP
.BR memkind_arena_destroy ()
is an implementation of the memkind "destroy" operation for memory
kinds that use jemalloc.  This releases all of the resources
allocated by
.BR memkind_arena_create ().
.PP
.BR memkind_arena_malloc ()
is an implementation of the memkind "malloc" operation for memory
kinds that use jemalloc.  This allocates memory using the arenas
created by
.BR memkind_arena_create ()
though the jemalloc
.BR jemk_mallocx ()
interface.  It uses the memkind "get_arena" operation to select the
arena.
.PP
.BR memkind_arena_calloc ()
is an implementation of the memkind "calloc" operation for memory
kinds that use jemalloc.  This allocates memory using the arenas
created by
.BR memkind_arena_create ()
though the jemalloc
.BR jemk_mallocx ()
interface.  It uses the memkind "get_arena" operation to select the
arena.
.PP
.BR memkind_arena_posix_memalign ()
is an implementation of the memkind "posix_memalign" operation for memory
kinds that use jemalloc.  This allocates memory using the arenas
created by
.BR memkind_arena_create ()
though the jemalloc
.BR jemk_mallocx ()
interface.  It uses the memkind "get_arena" operation to select the
arena.  The POSIX standard requires that
.BR posix_memalign (3)
may not set
.I errno
however the
.BR jemk_mallocx ()
routine may.  In an attempt to abide by the standard
.I errno
is recorded before calling
.BR jemk_mallocx ()
and then reset after the call.
.PP
.BR memkind_arena_realloc ()
is an implementation of the memkind "realloc" operation for memory
kinds that use jemalloc.  This allocates memory using the arenas
created by
.BR memkind_arena_create ()
though the jemalloc
.BR jemk_mallocx ()
interface.  It uses the memkind "get_arena" operation to select the
arena.
.PP
.BR memkind_thread_get_arena ()
Retrieves the
.I arena
index that is bound to to the calling thread based on a hash of its
thread ID.  The
.I arena
index can be used with the MALLOCX_ARENA macro to set flags for
.BR jemk_mallocx ().
.PP
.BR memkind_bijective_arena_get_arena ()
Retrieves the
.I arena
index to be used with the MALLOCX_ARENA macro to set flags for
.BR jemk_mallocx ().
Use of this operation implies that only one arena is used for the
.IR kind .
