.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
.BR memkind_error_message ()
converts an error number
.I err
returned by a member of the memkind
interface to an error message
.I msg
where the maximum size of the message is passed by the
.I size
parameter.

.B "HEAP MANAGMENT:"
.br
The functions described in this section define a heap manager with an
interface modeled on the ISO C standard API's, except that the user
must specify the
.I kind
of memory with the first argument to each function.  See the
.B KINDS
section below for a full description of the implemented kinds.
.PP
.BR memkind_malloc ()
allocates
.I size
bytes of uninitialized memory of the specified
.IR "kind" .
The allocated space is suitably aligned (after possible pointer
coercion) for storage of any type of object.  If
.I size
is 0, then
.BR memkind_malloc ()
returns  NULL.
.PP
.BR memkind_calloc ()
allocates space for
.I num
objects each
.I size
bytes in length in memory of the specified
.IR "kind" .
The result is identical to calling
.BR memkind_malloc ()
with an argument of
.IR num * size ,
with the exception that the allocated memory is explicitly
initialized to zero bytes.
If
.I num
or
.I size
is 0, then
.BR memkind_calloc ()
returns NULL.
.PP
.BR memkind_realloc ()
changes the size of the previously allocated memory referenced by
.I ptr
to
.I size
bytes of the specified
.IR "kind" .
The contents of the memory are unchanged up to the lesser of
the new and old sizes. If the new size is larger, the contents of the
newly allocated portion of the memory are undefined. Upon success, the
memory referenced by
.I ptr
is freed and a pointer to the newly allocated high bandwidth memory is
returned.

.BR Note:
.BR memkind_realloc ()
may move the memory allocation, resulting in a different return value
than
.IR "ptr" .

If
.I ptr
is NULL, the
.BR memkind_realloc ()
function behaves identically to
.BR memkind_malloc ()
for the specified size.
The address
.IR "ptr" ,
if not NULL, must have been returned by a previous call to
.BR memkind_malloc (),
.BR memkind_calloc (),
.BR memkind_realloc (),
or
.BR memkind_posix_memalign ()
with the same
.I kind
as specified to the call to
.BR memkind_realloc ().
Otherwise, if
.I memkind_free(kind, ptr)
was called before, undefined behavior occurs.
.PP
.BR memkind_posix_memalign ()
allocates
.I size
bytes of memory of a specified
.I kind
such that the allocation's base address
is an even multiple of
.IR "alignment" ,
and returns the allocation in the value pointed to by
.IR "memptr" .
The requested
.I alignment
must be a power of 2 at least as large as
.IR "sizeof(void *)" .
If
.I size
is 0, then
.BR memkind_posix_memalign ()
returns NULL.
.PP
.BR memkind_free ()
causes the allocated memory referenced by
.I ptr
to be made available for future allocations. This pointer
must have been returned by a previous call to
.BR memkind_malloc (),
.BR memkind_calloc (),
.BR memkind_realloc (),
or
.BR memkind_posix_memalign ().
Otherwise, if
.I memkind_free(kind, ptr)
was already called before, undefined behavior occurs.
If
.I ptr
is  NULL, no operation is performed.
The value of
.B MEMKIND_DEFAULT
can be given as the
.I kind
for all buffers allocated by a kind that leverages the jemalloc
allocator. In cases where the kind is unknown in the
context of the call to
.BR memkind_free ()
.B 0
can be given as the
.I kind
specified to
.BR memkind_free ()
but this will require a look up that can be bypassed by specifying
a non-zero value.
.sp
.B "ALLOCATOR CALLBACK FUNCTION:"
.br
This section describes the memkind interface which is used internally
by the heap manager.  For this API the kind is determined by the
partition index.  This enables the underlying heap manager to call
routines with standard type arguments, and allows the heap manager
implementation to be independent of the specifics of the
.I memkind_t
implementation.  Currently there is only one callback function.
.PP
.BR memkind_partition_mmap ()
which is a wrapper around the
.BR mmap (2)
system call.  The hint address
.I addr
and the length in bytes of the buffer to be
allocated
.I size
are passed through to
.BR mmap (2).
The other
.BR mmap (2)
parameters are determined by the kind operations.
.sp
.B "KIND MANAGEMENT:"
.br
There are built-in kinds that are always available, and these are enumerated in the
.B KINDS
section.  The user can also create their own kinds of memory.  This
section describes the API's that enable the tracking of the different
kinds of memory and determining their properties.
.PP
.BR memkind_create_pmem ()
is a convenience function used to create a file-backed kind of memory.
It allocates a temporary file in the given directory
.IR dir .
The file is created in a fashion similar to
.BR tmpfile (3),
so that the file name does not appear when the directory is listed and
the space is automatically freed when the program terminates.
The file is truncated to a size of
.I max_size
bytes and the resulting space is memory-mapped.
.br
Note that the actual file system space is not allocated immediately, but only
on a call to
.BR memkind_pmem_mmap ()
(see
.BR memkind_pmem (3)).
This allows to create a pmem memkind of a pretty large size without the
need to reserve in advance the corresponding file system space for the entire
heap.  The minimum
.I max_size
value allowed by the library is defined in
.B <memkind_pmem.h>
as
.BR MEMKIND_PMEM_MIN_SIZE .
Calling
.BR memkind_create_pmem ()
with a size smaller than that will return an error.
The maximum allowed size is not limited by
.BR memkind ,
but by the file system specified by the
.I dir
argument.
The
.I max_size
passed in is the raw size of the memory pool and
.B jemalloc
will use some of that space for its own metadata.
.PP
.BR memkind_check_available ()
Returns a zero if the specified
.I kind
is available or an error code from the
.B ERRORS
section if it is not.
.sp
.B "DECORATORS:"
.br
The memkind library enables the user to define decorator functions that
can be called before and after each memkind heap management API.  The
decorators that are called at the beginning of the function end are named
after that function with
.I _pre
appended to the name, and those that are called at the end of the
function are named after that function with
.I _post
appended to the name.  These are weak symbols, and if they are not
present at link time they are not called.  The memkind library does
not define these symbols which are reserved for user definition.
These decorators can be used to track calls to the heap management
interface or to modify parameters.  The decorators that are called at
the beginning of the allocator pass all inputs by reference, and the
decorators that are called at the end of the allocator pass the output
by reference.  This enables the modification of the input and output
of each heap management function by the decorators.
.sp
.B "LIBRARY VERSION"
.br
The memkind library version scheme consist major, minor and patch numbers separated by dot. Combining those numbers, we got the following representation:
.br
major.minor.patch, where:
.br
	-major number is incremented whenever API is changed (loss of backward compatibility),
.br
	-minor number is incremented whenever additional extensions are introduced, or behavior has been changed,
.br
	-patch number is incremented whenever small bug fixes are added.
.sp
memkind library provide numeric representation of the version by exposing the following API:
.br
int memkind_get_version() return version number represented by a single integer number, obtained from the formula:
.br
major * 1000000 + minor * 1000 + patch
.sp
Note: major < 1 means unstable API.
.sp
API standards:
.br
-STANDARD API, API is considered as stable
.br
-NON-STANDARD API, API is considered as stable, however this is not a standard way to use memkind
.br
-EXPERIMENTAL API, API is considered as unstable and the subject to change
.br
.sp
.B "MEMKIND OPERATIONS:"
.br
The
.I memkind_ops
structure is a vtable that defines the operations which determine the
kind of memory.  This design pattern is modeled after the "mix-in"
pattern used in the Linux kernel to enable some of the features of an
object oriented language in C.  This section defines the inputs,
outputs and responsibilities of each function pointer enumerated in the
.I memkind_ops
structure.  Each of these methods takes a
.B memkind_t
argument as its first parameter which shall be self referencing.  In this
documentation the function pointers in the
.I memkind_ops
structure will be prepended with
.RB """" ops. """"
and should be considered the operation associated with the
.IR kind .
.PP
.BI "int ops.create(memkind_t " "kind" ", struct memkind_ops " "*ops" ", const char " "*name" );
.br
shall instantiate all of the dynamic resources associated with the
.IR kind .
It takes a pointer to the vtable structure
.I ops
which has a function pointer for each of methods defined in this section
of the man page.  If any methods are unnecessary to the implementation of
the
.I kind
these function pointers shall be set to
.BR NULL .
The
.I name
string is an input parameter that identifies the kind of memory so
that it can be fetched with the
.BR memkind_get_kind_by_name ()
function.  Typically this method is either a pointer to the function
.BR memkind_default_create ()
defined in
.IR <memkind_default.h> ,
or a function that calls
.BR memkind_default_create ()
before performing other setup.
.PP
.BI "int ops.destroy(memkind_t " "kind" );
.br
shall free all of the dynamic resources reserved by the
.BR ops.create ()
method.  If no dynamic resources were explicitly allocated in the
.IR ops.create ()
method, this pointer can be set to
.BR NULL .
.PP

shall wrap the
.BR mmap (2)
.BR mbind (2)
and
.BR madvise (2)
system calls while passing
.I addr
and
.I size
through and determining all other parameters for
.BR mmap (2)
.BR mbind (2)
and
.BR madvise (2)
by calling other functions resolved by the
.B kind.ops
vtable.
This function shall return a virtual address to the memory mapped, or
.B MAP_FAILED
as defined in
.I <sys/mman.h>
which is
.IR "(void *) -1" .
.PP
.BI "int ops.mbind(memkind_t " "kind" ", void " "*ptr" ", size_t " "size" );
.br
shall wrap the
.BR mbind (2)
system call and pass through
the start address
.I ptr
to be bound, and the number of bytes
.I size
from that address to be bound.  The other parameters to
.BR mbind (2)
shall be determined by calling other functions resolved by the
.B kind.ops
vtable.
.PP
.BI "int ops.madvise(memkind_t " "kind" ", void " "*addr" ", size_t " "size" );
.br
shall wrap the
.BR madvise (2)
system call and pass through
the start address
.I addr
to be advised, and the number of bytes
.I size
from that address to be advised.  This may call
.BR madvise (2)
multiple times with different advice.
.PP
.BI "int ops.get_mmap_flags(memkind_t " "kind" ", int " "*flags" );
.br
shall set
.I flags
to a value appropriate for passing to the
.IR mmap (2)
system call for the
.IR kind .
.PP
.BI "int ops.get_mbind_mode(memkind_t " "kind" ", int " "*mode" );
.br
shall set

to a value appropriate for passing to the
.IR mmap (2)
system call for the
.IR kind .
.PP
.BI "int ops.get_mbind_nodemask(memkind_t " "kind" ", unsigned long " "*nodemask" ", unsigned long " "maxnode" );
.br
shall set the
.I nodemask
of length
.I maxnode
bits to a value appropriate for passing to the
.IR mbind (2)
system call for the
.IR kind .
.PP
.BI "int ops.get_arena(memkind_t " "kind" ", unsigned int " "*arena"," " size_t " "size" );
.br
shall set
.I arena
to an index appropriate for the
.I kind,
allocation
.I size,
and CPU when using the jemalloc arena allocation through the jemalloc's
.BR mallocx ()
API. Size parameter is not used at the moment, but will be necessary for integration with jemalloc 4.0.x (planned for one of the future releases).
.PP
.BI "int ops.get_size(memkind_t " "kind" ", size_t " "*total" ", size_t " "*free" );
.br
shall implement

as described above.
.PP
.BI "int ops.check_available(memkind_t " "kind" );
.br
shall return 0 if the
.I kind
is available on the system, and an error code if not.
.PP
.BI "int ops.check_addr(memkind_t " "kind" ", void " "*addr" ); (DEPRECATED)
.br
shall return 0 if the
.I addr
can be freed with the specified
.I kind
and an error code otherwise.  If the memory cannot be freed with jemalloc's
.BR free (),
then at least one of the instantiated kinds must return 0 to enable
freeing.
.PP
.BI "void ops.init_once(void);"
.br
this function pointer shall be set to NULL for any kind that is not
built-in.  The method is used to allocate dynamic resources for
built-in kinds without requiring and initialization routine.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.BR memkind_calloc (),
.BR memkind_malloc (),
and
.BR memkind_realloc (),
return the pointer to the allocated memory, or NULL if the request fails.
.BR memkind_free ()
and
.BR memkind_error_message ()
do not have return values.
All other memkind API's return 0 upon
success, and an error code defined in the ERRORS section upon failure.
The memkind library avoids setting
.I errno
directly, but calls to underlying libraries and system calls may set
.IR errno .
.SH "KINDS"

parameter is not a power of two, or is not a multiple of
.IR "sizoeof(void *)" ,
then
.B EINVAL
is returned.  If there is insufficient memory to satisfy the request then
.B ENOMEM

.SH "FILES"
.TP
.I /usr/bin/memkind-hbw-nodes
Prints a comma separated list of high bandwidth nodes.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.TP
.B MEMKIND_HBW_NODES
This environment variable is a comma separated list of NUMA nodes that
are treated as high bandwidth. Uses the
.I libnuma
routine
.BR numa_parse_nodestring ()
for parsing, so the syntax described in the
.BR numa (3)
man page for this routine applies: e.g 1-3,5 is a valid setting.
.TP
.B MEMKIND_ARENA_NUM_PER_KIND
This environment variable allows leveraging internal mechanism of
the library for setting number of arenas per kind. Value should be
a positive integer (not greater than INT_MAX defined in limits.h).
The user should set the value based on the characteristics
of application that is using the library. Higher value can
provide better performance in extremely multithreaded applications at
the cost of memory overhead. See section "IMPLEMENTATION NOTES" of
.BR jemalloc (3)
for more details about arenas.
.TP
.B MEMKIND_HOG_MEMORY
Controls behavior of memkind with regards to returning memory to underlaying OS. Setting
.B MEMKIND_HOG_MEMORY
to "1" causes memkind to not release memory to OS in anticipation of memory reuse soon. This will
improve latency of 'free' operations but increase memory usage.
.TP
.B MEMKIND_DEBUG
Controls logging mechanism in memkind. Setting
.B MEMKIND_DEBUG
to "1" enables printing messages like errors and general informations about environment to
.I stderr.
.TP
.B MEMKIND_HEAP_MANAGER
Controls heap management behavior in memkind library by switching to one of the available heap managers.
.br
Values:
.br
    JEMALLOC – sets the jamalloc heap manager
.br
    TBB – sets the Intel Threading Building Blocks heap manager. This option requires installed
    Intel Threading Building Blocks library.
If the MEMKIND_HEAP_MANAGER is not set than the jemalloc heap manager will be used by default.
.SH "SYSTEM CONFIGURATION"
Interfaces for obtaining 2MB (HUGETLB) need allocated
huge pages in the kernel's huge page pool.
.TP
.B HUGETLB (huge pages)
Current number of "persistent" huge pages can be read from /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages file.
Proposed way of setting hugepages is: "sudo sysctl vm.nr_hugepages=<number_of_hugepages>".
More informations can be found here:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt
.SH "STATIC LINKING"
.TP
When linking statically against memkind, libmemkind.a should be used together with its dependencies libnuma and pthread. Pthread can be linked by adding /usr/lib64/libpthread.a as a dependency (exact path may vary). Typically libnuma will need to be compiled from sources to use it as a static dependency. libnuma can be reached on github: https://github.com/numactl/numactl
.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
.TP
