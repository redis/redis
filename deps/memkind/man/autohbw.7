.SH "NAME"
libautohbw.so \- An interposer library for redirecting heap allocations
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.BR LD_PRELOAD=libautohbw.so
command {arguments ...}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B AutoHBW
library
.BR (libautohbw.so)
is an interposer library for redirecting heap allocations
.B (malloc, calloc, realloc, valloc, posix_memalign, memlign)
to high-bandwidth
.B (HBW)
memory. Consequently, AutoHBW library can be used to
automatically allocate high-bandwidth memory without any modification to
source code of an application.

.br
For instance, the following command-line runs existing binary /bin/ls with
AutoHBW library, automatically redirecting heap allocations (larger than a given
threshold) to high-bandwidth memory.
.IP
.B LD_PRELOAD=libautohbw.so
/bin/ls

.SH "ENVIRONMENT"

The behavior of AutoHBW library is controlled by the following environment
variables.

.PP
.B AUTO_HBW_SIZE=x:[y]
.br
Indicates that any allocation larger than
.I x
and smaller than
.I y
should be
allocated in HBW memory.
.I x
and
.I y
can be followed by a K, M, or G to indicate
the size in Kilo/Memga/Giga bytes (e.g., 4K, 3M, 2G).
.br

Examples:
.IP AUTO_HBW_SIZE=4K
# allocations larger than 4K allocated in HBW
.IP AUTO_HBW_SIZE=1M:5M
# allocations between 1M and 5M allocated in HBW

.PP
.B AUTO_HBW_LOG=level
.br
Sets the value of logging (printing)
.I level.
If
.I level
is:
.br
.IP -1
no messages are printed
.br
.IP 0
no allocations messages are printed but INFO messages are printed
.br
.IP 1
a log message is printed for each allocation (Default)
.br
.IP 2
a log message is printed for each allocation with a backtrace.
Redirect this output and use
.B autohbw_get_src_lines.pl
to find source lines for each allocation. Your application must
be compiled with
.B -g
to see source lines.
.PP
Notes:
.IP
1. Logging adds extra overhead. Therefore, for performance
critical runs, logging level should be 0
.IP
2. The amount of free memory printed with log messages is only
approximate -- e.g. pages that are not touched yet are excluded
.PP
Examples:
.IP AUTO_HBW_LOG=1

.PP
.B AUTO_HBW_MEM_TYPE=memory_type
.br
Sets the type of memory type that should be automatically allocated. By
default, this type is MEMKIND_HBW_PREFERRED, if MCDRAM is found in your
system; otherwise, the default is MEMKIND_DEFAULT. The names of memory
types are defined in
.B memkind(3)
man page.
.B memory_type
has to be one of
.B MEMKIND_DEFAULT, MEMKIND_HUGETLB, MEMKIND_INTERLEAVE, MEMKIND_HBW,
.B MEMKIND_HBW_PREFERRED, MEMKIND_HBW_HUGETLB, MEMKIND_HBW_PREFERRED_HUGETLB,
.B MEMKIND_HBW_GBTLB (DEPRECATED), MEMKIND_HBW_PREFERRED_GBTLB (DEPRECATED), MEMKIND_GBTLB (DEPRECATED),
.B MEMKIND_HBW_INTERLEAVE

If you are requesting any huge
TLB pages, please make sure that the requested type is currently enabled
in your OS.

Examples:
.IP AUTO_HBW_MEM_TYPE=MEMKIND_HBW_PREFERRED
# (default, if MCDRAM present)
.IP AUTO_HBW_MEM_TYPE=MEMKIND_DEFAULT
# (default, if MCDRAM absent)
.IP AUTO_HBW_MEM_TYPE=MEMKIND_HBW_HUGETLB
.IP AUTO_HBW_MEM_TYPE=MEMKIND_HUGETLB

.PP
.B AUTO_HBW_DEBUG=0|1|2
.br
Set the debug message printing level. Default is 0. This is mainly for
development.

.SH "NOTES"
It is possible to temporarily disable/enable automatic HBW allocations by
calling disableAutoHBW() and enableAutoHBW() in source code. To call
these routines, please include
.B autohbw_api.h
header file and link with -lautohbw.


.br
If high-bandwidth memory is not physically present in your system,
the environment variable
.B MEMKIND_HBW_NODES
must be set to indicate the high-bandwidth node as indicated in
.B memkind(3).


.SH "EXAMPLES"
.br
The following will run /bin/ls with AutoHBW library. Make sure that paths to
both libautohbw.so and libmemkind.so are included in
.B LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
.IP
.B LD_PRELOAD=libautohbw.so
/bin/ls -l
.PP
To run with MPI, a shell script must be created, with the correct LD_PRELOAD
command for each rank. For example, if we put
.B LD_PRELOAD=libautohbw.so /bin/ls
in a shell script named autohbw_test.sh, it can be executed with 2 MPI ranks as:
.br
.IP
.B mpirun -n 2 ./autohbw_test.sh
