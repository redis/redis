.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
High bandwidth memory memkind operations.
.PP
.BR memkind_hbw_check_available ()
returns zero if library was able to detect heterogeneous NUMA node
bandwidths.   Returns
.B MEMKIND_UNAVAILABLE
if the detection mechanism failed.
Detection mechanism can be also overridden by the
environment variable
.B MEMKIND_HBW_NODES
as described in the
.BR memkind (3)
man page.
.PP
.BR memkind_hbw_hugetlb_check_available ()
In addition to checking for high bandwidth memory as is done by
memkind_hbw_check_available (), this also checks for 2MB huge pages as
is done by memkind_hugetlb_check_available_2mb().
.PP
.BR memkind_hbw_gbtlb_check_available ()
In addition to checking for high bandwidth memory as is done by
memkind_hbw_check_available (), this also checks for 1GB huge pages as
is done by memkind_hugetlb_check_available_1gb().
.PP
.BR memkind_hbw_get_mbind_nodemask ()
sets the
.I nodemask
bit to one that corresponds to the high bandwidth NUMA node that has
the closest NUMA distance to the CPU of the calling process.
All other bits up to
.I maxnode
are set to zero.
The
.I nodemask
can be used in conjuction with the
.BR mbind (2)
system call.
.PP
.BR memkind_hbw_all_get_mbind_nodemask ()
sets the
.I nodemask
bits to one that correspond to the all high bandwidth NUMA nodes in
the system. All other bits up to
.I maxnode
are set to zero.
The
.I nodemask
can be used in conjuction with the
.BR mbind (2)
system call.
.PP
.BR memkind_hbw_init_once ()
This function initializes MEMKIND_HBW kind and it should not be called more than once.
Note:
.BR memkind_hbw_init_once ()
may reserve some extra memory.
.PP
.BR memkind_hbw_hugetlb_init_once ()
This function initializes MEMKIND_HBW_HUGETLB kind and it should not be called more than once.
Note:
.BR memkind_hbw_hugetlb_init_once ()
may reserve some extra memory.
.PP
.BR memkind_hbw_preferred_init_once ()
This function initializes MEMKIND_HBW_PREFERRED kind and it should not be called more than once.
Note:
.BR memkind_hbw_preferred_init_once ()
may reserve some extra memory.
.PP
.BR memkind_hbw_preferred_hugetlb_init_once ()
This function initializes MEMKIND_HBW_PREFERRED_HUGETLB kind and it should not be called more than once.
Note:
.BR memkind_hbw_preferred_hugetlb_init_once ()
may reserve some extra memory.
.PP
.BR memkind_hbw_interleave_init_once ()
This function initializes MEMKIND_HBW_INTERLEAVE kind and it should not be called more than once.
Note:
.BR memkind_hbw_interleave_init_once ()
may reserve some extra memory.
