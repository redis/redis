.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.BR hbw_check_available ()
returns 0 if high bandwidth memory is available and an error code
described in the
.B ERRORS
section if not.
.PP
.BR hbw_malloc ()
allocates
.I size
bytes of uninitialized high bandwidth memory. The allocated space is
suitably aligned (after possible pointer coercion) for storage of any
type of object. If
.I size
is zero then
.BR hbw_malloc ()
returns NULL.
.PP
.BR hbw_calloc ()
allocates space for
.I nmemb
objects in high bandwidth memory, each
.I size
bytes in length. The result is identical to calling
.BR hbw_malloc ()
with an argument of
.IR nmemb * size
, with the exception that the allocated memory is explicitly
initialized to zero bytes.  If
.I nmemb
or
.I size
is 0, then
.BR hbw_calloc ()
returns NULL.
.PP
.BR hbw_realloc ()
changes the size of the previously allocated high bandwidth memory
referenced by
.I ptr
to
.I size
bytes. The contents of the memory are unchanged up to the lesser of
the new and old sizes. If the new size is larger, the contents of the
newly allocated portion of the memory are undefined. Upon success, the
memory referenced by
.I ptr
is freed and a pointer to the newly allocated high bandwidth memory is
returned.

.B Note:
.BR hbw_realloc ()
may move the memory allocation, resulting in a different return value
than
.IR "ptr" .

If
.I ptr
is NULL, the
.BR hbw_realloc ()
function behaves identically to
.BR hbw_malloc ()
for the specified size.
The address
.IR "ptr" ,
if not NULL, was returned by a previous call to
.BR hbw_malloc (),
.BR hbw_calloc (),
.BR hbw_realloc (),
or
.BR hbw_posix_memalign ().
Otherwise, or if
.I hbw_free(ptr)
was called before, undefined behavior occurs.


.B Note:
.BR hbw_realloc ()
cannot be used with a pointer returned by
.BR hbw_posix_memalign_psize ().

.PP
.BR hbw_free ()
causes the allocated memory referenced by
.I ptr
to be made available for future allocations. If
.I ptr
is NULL, no action occurs.
The address
.IR "ptr" ,
if not NULL, must have been returned by a previous call to
.BR hbw_malloc (),
.BR hbw_calloc (),
.BR hbw_realloc (),
.BR hbw_posix_memalign (),
or
.BR hbw_posix_memalign_psize ().
Otherwise, if
.I hbw_free(ptr)
was called before, undefined behavior occurs.
.PP
.BR hbw_posix_memalign ()
allocates
.I size
bytes of high bandwidth memory such that the allocation's base address
is an even multiple of
.IR "alignment" ,
and returns the allocation in the value pointed to by
.IR "memptr" .
The requested
.I alignment
must be a power of 2 at least as large as
.IR "sizeof(void *)" .
.PP
.BR hbw_posix_memalign_psize ()
allocates
.I size
bytes of high bandwidth memory such that the allocation's base address
is an even multiple of
.IR "alignment" ,
and returns the allocation in the value pointed to by
.IR "memptr" .
The requested
.I alignment
must be a power of 2 at least as large as
.IR "sizeof(void *)" .
The memory will be allocated using pages determined by the
.IR "pagesize"
variable which may be one of the following enumerated values:
.TP
.B HBW_PAGESIZE_4KB
The four kilobyte page size option. Note that with transparent huge
pages enabled these allocations may be promoted by the operating
system to two megabyte pages.
.TP
.B HBW_PAGESIZE_2MB
The two megabyte page size option. Note: This page size requires
huge pages configuration described in SYSTEM CONFIGURATION section.
.TP
.B HBW_PAGESIZE_1GB
This option allows the user to specify arbitrary sizes backed by
one gigabytes pages. Gigabyte pages are allocated even if the
size is not a modulo of 1GB. A good example of using this feature
with realloc is shown in gb_realloc_example.c. Note: This page size requires
gigabyte pages configuration described in SYSTEM CONFIGURATION section.
.TP
.B HBW_PAGESIZE_1GB_STRICT
The one gigabyte page size option. The total size of the allocation
must be a multiple of 1GB with this option, otherwise the allocation
will fail. Note: This page size requires gigabyte pages configuration
described in SYSTEM CONFIGURATION section.
.PP
.BR hbw_get_policy ()
returns the current fallback policy when insufficient high bandwith
memory is available.
.PP
.BR hbw_set_policy ()
sets the current fallback policy. The policy can be modified only once in the lifetime  of  an  application and before calling hbw_*alloc() or hbw_posix_memalign*() function.
.br
Note: If the policy is not set, than HBW_POLICY_PREFERRED will be used by default.
.TP
.B HBW_POLICY_BIND
If insufficient high bandwidth memory from the nearest NUMA node is
available to satisfy a request, the allocated pointer is set to NULL
and
.I errno
is set to ENOMEM.  If insufficient high bandwidth memory pages are
available at fault time the Out Of Memory (OOM) killer is triggered.
Note that pages are faulted exclusively from the high bandwidth NUMA
node nearest at time of allocation, not at time of fault.
.TP
.B HBW_POLICY_PREFERRED
If insufficient memory is available from the high bandwidth NUMA node
closest at allocation time, fall back to standard memory (default)
with the smallest NUMA distance.
.TP
.B HBW_POLICY_INTERLEAVE
Interleave faulted pages from across all high bandwidth NUMA nodes
using standard size pages (the Transparent Huge Page feature is
disabled).
.PP
.BR hbw_verify_memory_region ()
verifies if memory region fully fall into high bandwidth memory. Returns:
0 if memory in address range from
.IR "addr"
to
.IR "addr"
+
.IR "size"
is allocated in high bandwidth memory,
-1 if any fragment of memory was not backed by high bandwidth memory [e.g. when memory is not initalized]
or one of error codes described in ERRORS section.

Using this function in production code may result in serious performance penalty.

.IR Flags
argument may include optional flags that modifies function behaviour:
.TP
.B HBW_TOUCH_PAGES
Before checking pages, function will touch first byte of all pages in address range starting from
.IR "addr"
to
.IR "addr"
+
.IR "size"
by read and write (so the content will be overwitten by the same data as it was read).
Using this option may trigger Out Of Memory killer.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.BR hbw_get_policy ()
returns
.B HBW_POLICY_BIND
or
.B HBW_POLICY_PREFERRED
which represents the current high bandwidth policy.
.BR hbw_free ()
do not have return value.
.BR hbw_malloc ()
.BR hbw_calloc (),
and
.BR hbw_realloc ()
return the pointer to the allocated memory, or NULL if the request
fails.
.BR hbw_posix_memalign (),
.BR hbw_posix_memalign_psize ()
and
.BR hbw_set_policy ()
return zero on success and return an error code
as described in the
.B ERRORS
section below on failure.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
Error codes described here are the POSIX standard error codes as defined in <errno.h>
.TP
.BR hbw_check_available ()
returns
.BR ENODEV
if high-bandwidth memory is unavailable.
.TP
.BR "hbw_posix_memalign" "() and " "hbw_posix_memalign_psize" "()"
If the
.I alignment
parameter is not a power of two, or was not a multiple of
.IR "sizoeof(void *)" ,
then
.B EINVAL
is returned. If there was insufficient memory to satisfy the request then
.B ENOMEM
is returned.
.TP
.BR hbw_set_policy ()
returns
.B EPERM
if hbw_set_policy () was called more than once, or
.B EINVAL if
.I mode
argument was neither
.B HBW_POLICY_PREFERRED,
.B HBW_POLICY_BIND
nor
.B HBW_POLICY_INTERLEAVE.
.TP
.BR hbw_verify_memory_region ()
returns
.B EINVAL
if
.IR "addr"
is NULL,
.IR "size"
equals 0 or
.IR "flags"
contained unsupported bit set. If memory pointed by
.IR "addr"
could not be verified then
.B EFAULT
is returned.
.SH "NOTES"
The
.I hbwmalloc.h
file defines the external functions and enumerations for the hbwmalloc
library. These interfaces define a heap manager that targets high
bandwidth memory numa nodes.
.SH "FILES"
.TP
.I /usr/bin/memkind-hbw-nodes
Prints a comma separated list of high bandwidth nodes.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.TP
.B MEMKIND_HBW_NODES
This environment variable is a comma separated list of NUMA nodes that
are treated as high bandwidth. Uses the
.I libnuma
routine
.BR numa_parse_nodestring ()
for parsing, so the syntax described in the
.BR numa (3)
man page for this routine applies for example: 1-3,5 is a valid setting.
.TP
.B MEMKIND_ARENA_NUM_PER_KIND
This environment variable allows leveraging internal mechanism of
the library for setting number of arenas per kind. Value should be
a positive integer (not greater than INT_MAX defined in limits.h).
The user should set the value based on the characteristics
of application that is using the library. Higher value can
provide better performance in extremely multithreaded applications at
the cost of memory overhead. See section "IMPLEMENTATION NOTES" of
.BR jemalloc (3)
for more details about arenas.
.SH "SYSTEM CONFIGURATION"
Interfaces for obtaining 2MB and 1GB pages (HUGETLB and GBTLB) need allocated
huge pages in the kernel's huge page pool.
.TP
.B HUGETLB (huge pages)
Current number of "persistent" huge pages can be read from /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages file.
Proposed way of setting hugepages is: "sudo sysctl vm.nr_hugepages=<number_of_hugepages>".
More informations can be found here:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt
.TP
.B GBTLB (gigabyte pages)
Number of preallocated gigabyte pages can be read from /proc/cmdline
(hugepagesz=1G nr_hugepages=N). Setting gigabyte hugepages is available
by kernel commandline. From 3.16 and later kernels, users can allocate
gigabyte pages like its done for 2MB pages.
.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
.TP
.B HUGETLB (huge pages)
There might be some overhead in huge pages consumption caused by heap management.
If your allocation fails because of OOM, please try to allocate extra huge pages (e.g. 8 huge pages).
