            <remarks>
            For compression, the delegate accepts a stream that writes to the archive
            and returns a wrapper stream that compresses bytes as they are written.
            For decompression, the delegate accepts a stream that reads from the archive
            and returns a wrapper stream that decompresses bytes as they are read.
            This wrapper stream model follows the design used by
            System.IO.Compression.DeflateStream, and indeed that class is used
            to implement the Deflate compression method by default.

            When the ZipEngine class is initialized, the Deflate compression method
