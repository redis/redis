                Improves the performance of managed applications by creating native images.
                Requires the .NET Framework 2.0 or newer to be installed on the target machine since
                it runs <html:a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6t9t5wcf.aspx">NGen</html:a>.

                <xse:remarks>
                    <html:p>
                        Native images are files containing compiled processor-specific machine code, which
                        are installed into the native image cache on the local computer. The runtime
                        can use native images from the cache instead using the just-in-time (JIT)
                        compiler to compile the original assembly.
                    </html:p>
                    <html:p>
                        The native image custom actions are configured to ignore failures so that failing
                        to generate or remove a native image will not cause setup to fail and roll back.
                    </html:p>
                    <html:p>
                        <html:b>Note for patches:</html:b> if you built your target, or baseline, MSI with
                        previous versions 3.0 or 3.5 of this extension and want to upgrade to formattable
                        values for @AssemblyApplication or @AppBaseDirectory you must also include a
                        BinaryRef to "NetFxCA" to pull in necessary changes. If you do use formattable
                        values and do not include the binary changes ngen.exe will not optimize your
                        native images for the specified application.
                    </html:p>
                    <html:p>
                        This should be a rare occurrence, however. Because you cannot remove components
                        in a patch - and pyro does validate you do not - it is not practical to switch
                        from using identifiers to formattable values in a patch. One practical possibility
                        is if you wanted to use a different application to optimize your native images
                        and that application is not already installed with the MSI to be updated.

                            assembly.  For EXE assemblies, this attribute does not need to be set because NGen
                            will use the directory of the assembly file by default.

                            For DLL assemblies which are loaded via reflection, this attribute should
                            be set to indicate the application which will load this assembly.
                            The configuration of the application (usually specified via an exe.config file) will be used
                            to determine how to resolve dependencies for this assembly.

                            The value can be in the form of a file identifier, or a formatted string
                            that resolves to either a file identifier or a full path to a file.

                            When a shared component is loaded at run time, using the Load method, the
                            application's configuration file determines the dependencies that are loaded
                            for the shared component — for example, the version of a dependency that is loaded.
                            This attribute gives guidance on which dependencies would be loaded at run time in order
                            to figure out which dependency assemblies will also need to have native images generated
                            (assuming the Dependency attribute is not set to "no").

                            File element (please note that these attributes both refer to the same application
                            assembly but do very different things: specifiying File/@AssemblyApplication will force
                            an assembly to install to a private location next to the indicated application, whereas
                            this AssemblyApplication attribute will be used to help resolve dependent assemblies
                            while generating native images for this assembly).
