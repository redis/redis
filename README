Where to find complete Redis documentation?
-------------------------------------------

This README is just a fast "quick start" document. You can find more detailed
documentation at http://redis.io

Building Redis
--------------

It is as simple as:

    % make

Redis is just a single binary, but if you want to install it you can use
the "make install" target that will copy the binary in /usr/local/bin
for default. You can also use "make PREFIX=/some/other/directory install"
if you wish to use a different destination.

You can run a 32 bit Redis binary using:

    % make 32bit

After building Redis is a good idea to test it, using:

    % make test

NOTE: if after building Redis with a 32 bit target you need to rebuild it
      with a 64 bit target you need to perform a "make clean" in the root
      directory of the Redis distribution.

Allocator
---------

By default Redis compiles and links against jemalloc under Linux, since
glibc malloc() has memory fragmentation problems.

To force a libc malloc() build use:

    make FORCE_LIBC_MALLOC=yes

In all the other non Linux systems the libc malloc() is used by default.

On Mac OS X you can force a jemalloc based build using the following:

    make USE_JEMALLOC=yes

Verbose build
-------------

Redis will build with a user friendly colorized output by default.
If you want to see a more verbose output use the following:

    make V=1

Running Redis
-------------

To run Redis with the default configuration just type:

    % cd src
    % ./redis-server
    
If you want to provide your redis.conf, you have to run it using an additional
parameter (the path of the configuration file):

    % cd src
    % ./redis-server /path/to/redis.conf

Playing with Redis
------------------

You can use redis-cli to play with Redis. Start a redis-server instance,
then in another terminal try the following:

    % cd src
    % ./redis-cli
    redis> ping
    PONG
    redis> set foo bar
    OK
    redis> get foo
    "bar"
    redis> incr mycounter
    (integer) 1
    redis> incr mycounter
    (integer) 2
    redis> 

You can find the list of all the available commands here:

Enjoy!
