If you are reporting a security bug, please contact the core team privately
by emailing redis@redis.io. Your report will be acknowledged by a core team
member and once the report has been reviewed you will receive a more detailed
response including next steps.

If you do not receive a reply you can escalate to the Redis Google Group,
found in [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING). Because this group is a public space please do not disclose the
issue in detail, only say that you are trying to reach the core team for a
security issue.

Redis follows a responsible disclosure process:

1. Reports are reviewed and analyzed privately
2. Patches are prepared for supported versions of Redis
3. Vendor lists are notified with an embargo date to reduce the public impact
4. We push a fix release and your bug can be posted publicly with credit in
   release notes and the version history (and our thanks!)
