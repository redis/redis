/* Representation of a radix tree as implemented in this file, that contains
 * the strings "foo", "foobar" and "footer" after the insertion of each
 * word. When the node represents a key inside the radix tree, we write it
 * between [], otherwise it is written between ().
 *
 * This is the vanilla representation:
 *
 *              (f) ""
 *                \
 *                (o) "f"
 *                  \
 *                  (o) "fo"
 *                    \
 *                  [t   b] "foo"
 *                  /     \
 *         "foot" (e)     (a) "foob"
 *                /         \
 *      "foote" (r)         (r) "fooba"
 *              /             \
 *    "footer" []             [] "foobar"
 *
 * However, this implementation implements a very common optimization where
 * successive nodes having a single child are "compressed" into the node
 * itself as a string of characters, each representing a next-level child,
 * and only the link to the node representing the last character node is
 * provided inside the representation. So the above representation is turned
 * into:
 *
 *                  ["foo"] ""
 *                     |
 *                  [t   b] "foo"
 *                  /     \
 *        "foot" ("er")    ("ar") "foob"
 *                 /          \
 *       "footer" []          [] "foobar"
 *
 * However this optimization makes the implementation a bit more complex.
 * For instance if a key "first" is added in the above radix tree, a
 * "node splitting" operation is needed, since the "foo" prefix is no longer
 * composed of nodes having a single child one after the other. This is the
 * above tree and the resulting node splitting after this event happens:
 *
 *
 *                    (f) ""
 *                    /
 *                 (i o) "f"
 *                 /   \
 *    "firs"  ("rst")  (o) "fo"
 *              /        \
 *    "first" []       [t   b] "foo"
 *                     /     \
 *           "foot" ("er")    ("ar") "foob"
 *                    /          \
 *          "footer" []          [] "foobar"
 *
 * Similarly after deletion, if a new chain of nodes having a single child
 * is created (the chain must also not include nodes that represent keys),
 * it must be compressed back into a single node.
