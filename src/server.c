/* Our command table.
 *
 * Every entry is composed of the following fields:
 *
 * name: a string representing the command name.
 * function: pointer to the C function implementing the command.
 * arity: number of arguments, it is possible to use -N to say >= N
 * sflags: command flags as string. See below for a table of flags.
 * flags: flags as bitmask. Computed by Redis using the 'sflags' field.
 * get_keys_proc: an optional function to get key arguments from a command.
 *                This is only used when the following three fields are not
 *                enough to specify what arguments are keys.
 * first_key_index: first argument that is a key
 * last_key_index: last argument that is a key
 * key_step: step to get all the keys from first to last argument. For instance
 *           in MSET the step is two since arguments are key,val,key,val,...
 * microseconds: microseconds of total execution time for this command.
 * calls: total number of calls of this command.
 *
 * The flags, microseconds and calls fields are computed by Redis and should
 * always be set to zero.
 *
 * Command flags are expressed using strings where every character represents
 * a flag. Later the populateCommandTable() function will take care of
 * populating the real 'flags' field using this characters.
 *
 * This is the meaning of the flags:
 *
 * w: write command (may modify the key space).
 * r: read command  (will never modify the key space).
 * m: may increase memory usage once called. Don't allow if out of memory.
 * a: admin command, like SAVE or SHUTDOWN.
 * p: Pub/Sub related command.
 * f: force replication of this command, regardless of server.dirty.
 * s: command not allowed in scripts.
 * R: random command. Command is not deterministic, that is, the same command
 *    with the same arguments, with the same key space, may have different
 *    results. For instance SPOP and RANDOMKEY are two random commands.
 * S: Sort command output array if called from script, so that the output
 *    is deterministic.
 * l: Allow command while loading the database.
 * t: Allow command while a slave has stale data but is not allowed to
 *    server this data. Normally no command is accepted in this condition
 *    but just a few.
 * M: Do not automatically propagate the command on MONITOR.
 * k: Perform an implicit ASKING for this command, so the command will be
 *    accepted in cluster mode if the slot is marked as 'importing'.
 * F: Fast command: O(1) or O(log(N)) command that should never delay
 *    its execution as long as the kernel scheduler is giving us time.
 *    Note that commands that may trigger a DEL as a side effect (like SET)
 *    are not fast commands.
