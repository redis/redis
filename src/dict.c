/* Our dict is implemented as a Hash Array Mapped Trie (HAMT). The hash (result
 * of a hash function) of each key is stored in a a tree structure where each
 * node has up to 32 children. With this large branching factor, the tree never
 * becomes very deep (6-7 levels). The time complexity is O(log32 n), which is
 * very close to constant.
 *
 * This is our HAMT structure:
 *
 * +--------------------+
 * | dict               |
 * |--------------------|   +--------------------+   +--------------------+
 * | bitmaps | children---->| bitmaps | children---->| key     | value    |
 * | size               |   | key     | value    |   | ...     | ...      |
 * | dictType           |   | key     | value    |   +--------------------+
 * | privdata           |   | key     | value    |
 * +--------------------+   | key     | value    |   +--------------------+
 *                          | bitmaps | children---->| key     | value    |
 *                          | key     | value    |   | bitmaps | children--->..
 *                          | ...     | ...      |   | value   | key      |
 *                          +--------------------+   | ...     | ...      |
 *                                                   +--------------------+
 *
 * In each level, 5 bits of the hash is used as an index into the children. A
 * bitmap indicates which of the children exist (1) and which don't (0). Whether
 * the child is a leaf or a subnode is indicated by a second bitmap, "leafmap".
 *
 * hash(key) = 0010 10010 01011 00101 01001 10110 11101
 * (64 bits)   10101 11001 01001 01101 10111 11010
 *                                           ^^^^^
 *                                             26
 *
 * bitmap    = 00100101 00000010 00010100 01100001
 * (level 0)        ^
 *                  bit 26 is 1, so there is a child node or leaf
 *
 * leafmap   = 00000100 00000010 00010000 01100000
 * (level 0)        ^
 *                  bit 26 is 1, so the child is a key-value entry
 *
 * The children array is compact and its length is equal to the number of 1s in
 * the bitmap. In the bitmap above, our bit is the 2nd 1-bit from the left, so
 * we look at the 2nd child.
 *
 * children  = +--------------------+
 *             | bitmaps | children |
 *             | key     | value    | <-- The 2nd child is a key-value entry. If
 *             | bitmaps | children |     the key matches our key, then it's our
 *             | ...     | ...      |     key. Otherwise, the dict doesn't
 *             +--------------------+     contain our key.
 *
 * If, instead, our child is a subnode, we use the next 5 bits from the hash to
 * index into the next level of children.
 *
 * The HAMT is described in Phil Bagwell (2000). Ideal Hash Trees.
 * https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/64398/files/idealhashtrees.pdf
 *
 * Until 2021, the dictionary was implemented as a hash table with incremental
 * rehashing using two hash tables while rehashing and resized in powers of two.
 * Despite the incremental rehashing, allocating and freeing very large
 * continuous memory is expensive. The memory usage was also higher than for the
 * HAMT. */

/* dictScan() is used to iterate over the elements of a dictionary.
 *
 * Iterating works the following way:
 *
 * 1) Initially you call the function using a cursor (v) value of 0.
 * 2) The function performs one step of the iteration, and returns the
 *    new cursor value you must use in the next call.
 * 3) When the returned cursor is 0, the iteration is complete.
 *
 * The function guarantees all elements present in the
 * dictionary get returned between the start and end of the iteration.
 * However it is possible some elements get returned multiple times.
 *
 * For every element returned, the callback argument 'fn' is
 * called with 'privdata' as first argument and the dictionary entry
 * 'de' as second argument.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS.
 *
 * The cursor is basically a path into the hash tree. The keys are iterated in
 * the order of how they are stored in the hash tree, in depth first order. The
 * 5 least significant bits of the cursor are used as an index into the first
 * level of nodes. The next 5 bits are used an index into the next level and so
 * forth.
 *
 * LIMITATIONS
 *
 * This iterator is completely stateless, and this is a huge advantage,
 * including no additional memory used.
 *
 * It also has the following nice properties:
 *
 * 1) No duplicates. Each element is returned only once.
 *
 * 2) The iterator can usually return exactly the requested number of entries.
 *    The exception is when there are multiple keys with exactly the same 64-bit
 *    hash value. These are always returned together, since they correspond to
 *    the same cursor value.
 *
 * The disadvantages resulting from this design is:
 *
 * 1) The cursor is somewhat hard to understand at first, but this comment is
 *    supposed to help.
