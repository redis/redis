  * If USE_DL_PREFIX is defined, it is assumed that malloc.c 
    was also compiled with this option, so all routines

  * If HAVE_USR_INCLUDE_MALLOC_H is defined, it is assumed that this

    your system defines a struct mallinfo that is incompatible with the
    standard one declared here.  Otherwise, you can include this file
    INSTEAD of your system system <malloc.h>.  At least on ANSI, all
    declarations should be compatible with system versions

  independent_calloc(size_t n_elements, size_t element_size, void* chunks[]);

  independent_calloc is similar to calloc, but instead of returning a
  single cleared space, it returns an array of pointers to n_elements
  independent elements that can hold contents of size elem_size, each
  of which starts out cleared, and can be independently freed,
  realloc'ed etc. The elements are guaranteed to be adjacently
  allocated (this is not guaranteed to occur with multiple callocs or
  mallocs), which may also improve cache locality in some
  applications.

  The "chunks" argument is optional (i.e., may be null, which is
  probably the most typical usage). If it is null, the returned array
  is itself dynamically allocated and should also be freed when it is
  no longer needed. Otherwise, the chunks array must be of at least
  n_elements in length. It is filled in with the pointers to the
  chunks.

  In either case, independent_calloc returns this pointer array, or
  null if the allocation failed.  If n_elements is zero and "chunks"
  is null, it returns a chunk representing an array with zero elements
  (which should be freed if not wanted).

  Each element must be freed when it is no longer needed. This can be
  done all at once using bulk_free.

  independent_calloc simplifies and speeds up implementations of many
  kinds of pools.  It may also be useful when constructing large data
  structures that initially have a fixed number of fixed-sized nodes,
  but the number is not known at compile time, and some of the nodes
  may later need to be freed. For example:

  struct Node { int item; struct Node* next; };

  struct Node* build_list() {
    struct Node** pool;
    int n = read_number_of_nodes_needed();
    if (n <= 0) return 0;
    pool = (struct Node**)(independent_calloc(n, sizeof(struct Node), 0);
    if (pool == 0) die();
    // organize into a linked list...
    struct Node* first = pool[0];
    for (i = 0; i < n-1; ++i)
      pool[i]->next = pool[i+1];
    free(pool);     // Can now free the array (or not, if it is needed later)
    return first;
  }
*/
void** dlindependent_calloc(size_t, size_t, void**);

/*
  independent_comalloc(size_t n_elements, size_t sizes[], void* chunks[]);

  independent_comalloc allocates, all at once, a set of n_elements
  chunks with sizes indicated in the "sizes" array.    It returns
  an array of pointers to these elements, each of which can be
  independently freed, realloc'ed etc. The elements are guaranteed to
  be adjacently allocated (this is not guaranteed to occur with
  multiple callocs or mallocs), which may also improve cache locality
  in some applications.

  The "chunks" argument is optional (i.e., may be null). If it is null
  the returned array is itself dynamically allocated and should also
  be freed when it is no longer needed. Otherwise, the chunks array
  must be of at least n_elements in length. It is filled in with the
  pointers to the chunks.

  In either case, independent_comalloc returns this pointer array, or
  null if the allocation failed.  If n_elements is zero and chunks is
  null, it returns a chunk representing an array with zero elements
  (which should be freed if not wanted).

  Each element must be freed when it is no longer needed. This can be
  done all at once using bulk_free.

  independent_comallac differs from independent_calloc in that each
  element may have a different size, and also that it does not
  automatically clear elements.

  independent_comalloc can be used to speed up allocation in cases
  where several structs or objects must always be allocated at the
  same time.  For example:

  struct Head { ... }
  struct Foot { ... }

  void send_message(char* msg) {
    int msglen = strlen(msg);
    size_t sizes[3] = { sizeof(struct Head), msglen, sizeof(struct Foot) };
    void* chunks[3];
    if (independent_comalloc(3, sizes, chunks) == 0)
      die();
    struct Head* head = (struct Head*)(chunks[0]);
    char*        body = (char*)(chunks[1]);
    struct Foot* foot = (struct Foot*)(chunks[2]);
    // ...
  }

  In general though, independent_comalloc is worth using only for
  larger values of n_elements. For small values, you probably won't
  detect enough difference from series of malloc calls to bother.

  Overuse of independent_comalloc can increase overall memory usage,
  since it cannot reuse existing noncontiguous small chunks that
  might be available for some of the elements.

  large blocks of memory to potentially reduce the system-level memory
  requirements of a program. However, it cannot guarantee to reduce
  memory. Under some allocation patterns, some large free blocks of
  memory will be locked between two used chunks, so they cannot be
  given back to the system.

  The `pad' argument to malloc_trim represents the amount of free
  trailing space to leave untrimmed. If this argument is zero, only
