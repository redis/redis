 * so the pool may contain keys that no longer exist.

 * LFU (Least Frequently Used) implementation.

 * We have 24 total bits of space in each object in order to implement
 * an LFU (Least Frequently Used) eviction policy, since we re-use the
 * LRU field for this purpose.
 *
 * We split the 24 bits into two fields:
 *
 *          16 bits      8 bits
 *     +----------------+--------+
 *     + Last decr time | LOG_C  |
 *     +----------------+--------+
 *
 * LOG_C is a logarithmic counter that provides an indication of the access
 * frequency. However this field must also be decremented otherwise what used
 * to be a frequently accessed key in the past, will remain ranked like that
 * forever, while we want the algorithm to adapt to access pattern changes.
 *
 * So the remaining 16 bits are used in order to store the "decrement time",
 * a reduced-precision Unix time (we take 16 bits of the time converted
 * in minutes since we don't care about wrapping around) where the LOG_C
 * counter is halved if it has an high value, or just decremented if it
 * has a low value.
 *
 * New keys don't start at zero, in order to have the ability to collect
 * some accesses before being trashed away, so they start at COUNTER_INIT_VAL.
 * The logarithmic increment performed on LOG_C takes care of COUNTER_INIT_VAL
 * when incrementing the key, so that keys starting at COUNTER_INIT_VAL
 * (or having a smaller value) have a very high chance of being incremented
 * on access.
 *
 * During decrement, the value of the logarithmic counter is halved if
 * its current value is greater than two times the COUNTER_INIT_VAL, otherwise
 * it is just decremented by one.
