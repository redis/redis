/* CRC16 implementation according to CCITT standards.
 *
 * Note by @antirez: this is actually the XMODEM CRC 16 algorithm, using the
 * following parameters:
 *
 * Name                       : "XMODEM", also known as "ZMODEM", "CRC-16/ACORN"
 * Width                      : 16 bit
 * Poly                       : 1021 (That is actually x^16 + x^12 + x^5 + 1)
 * Initialization             : 0000
 * Reflect Input byte         : False
 * Reflect Output CRC         : False
 * Xor constant to output CRC : 0000
 * Output for "123456789"     : 31C3
