/* Try to expire a few timed out keys. The algorithm used is adaptive and
 * will use few CPU cycles if there are few expiring keys, otherwise
 * it will get more aggressive to avoid that too much memory is used by
 * keys that can be removed from the keyspace.
 *
 * Every expire cycle tests multiple databases: the next call will start
 * again from the next db. No more than CRON_DBS_PER_CALL databases are
 * tested at every iteration.
 *
 * The function can perform more or less work, depending on the "type"
 * argument. It can execute a "fast cycle" or a "slow cycle". The slow
 * cycle is the main way we collect expired cycles: this happens with
 * the "server.hz" frequency (usually 10 hertz).
 *
 * However the slow cycle can exit for timeout, since it used too much time.
 * For this reason the function is also invoked to perform a fast cycle
 * at every event loop cycle, in the beforeSleep() function. The fast cycle
 * will try to perform less work, but will do it much more often.
 *
 * The following are the details of the two expire cycles and their stop
 * conditions:
 *
 * If type is ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_FAST the function will try to run a
 * "fast" expire cycle that takes no longer than ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_FAST_DURATION
 * microseconds, and is not repeated again before the same amount of time.
 * The cycle will also refuse to run at all if the latest slow cycle did not
 * terminate because of a time limit condition.
 *
 * If type is ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_SLOW, that normal expire cycle is
 * executed, where the time limit is a percentage of the REDIS_HZ period
 * as specified by the ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_SLOW_TIME_PERC define. In the
 * fast cycle, the check of every database is interrupted once the number
 * of already expired keys in the database is estimated to be lower than
 * a given percentage, in order to avoid doing too much work to gain too
 * little memory.
 *
 * The configured expire "effort" will modify the baseline parameters in
 * order to do more work in both the fast and slow expire cycles.
