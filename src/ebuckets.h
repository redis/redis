 *
 * WHAT IS EBUCKETS?
 * -----------------
 * ebuckets is being used to store items that are set with expiration-time. It
 * supports the basic API of add, remove and active expiration. The implementation
 * of it is based on rax-tree, or plain linked-list when small. The expiration time
 * of the items are used as the key to traverse rax-tree.
 *
 * Instead of holding a distinct item in each leaf of the rax-tree we can aggregate
 * items into small segments and hold it in each leaf. This way we can  avoid
 * frequent modification of the rax-tree, since many of the modifications
 * will be done only at the segment level. It will also save memory because
 * rax-tree can be costly, around 40 bytes per leaf (with rax-key limited to 6
 * bytes). Whereas each additional item in the segment will cost the size of the
 * 'next' pointer in a list (8 bytes) and few more bytes for maintenance of the
 * segment.
 *
 * EBUCKETS STRUCTURE
 * ------------------
 * The ebuckets data structure is organized in a hierarchical manner as follows:
 *
 * 1. ebuckets: This is the top-level data structure. It can be either a rax tree
 *    or a plain linked list. It contains one or more buckets, each representing
 *    an interval in time.
 *
 * 2. bucket: Each bucket represents an interval in time and contains one or more
 *    segments. The key in the rax-tree for each bucket represents low
 *    bound expiration-time for the items within this bucket. The key of the
 *    following bucket represents the upper bound expiration-time.
 *
 * 3. segment: Each segment within a bucket can hold up to `EB_SEG_MAX_ITEMS`
 *    items as a linked list. If there are more, the segment will try to
 *    split the bucket. To avoid wasting memory, it is a singly linked list (only
 *    next-item pointer). It is a cyclic linked-list to allow efficient removal of
 *    items from the middle of the segment without traversing the rax tree.
 *
 * 4. item: Each item that is stored in ebuckets should embed the ExpireMeta
 *    struct and supply getter function (see EbucketsType.getExpireMeta). This
 *    struct holds the expire-time of the item and few more fields that are used
 *    to maintain the segments data-structure.
 *
 * SPLITTING BUCKET
 * ----------------
 * Each segment can hold up-to `EB_SEG_MAX_ITEMS` items. On insertion of new
 * item, it will try to split the segment. Here is an example For adding item
 * with expiration of 42 to a segment that already reached its maximum capacity
 * which will cause to split of the segment and in turn split of the bucket as
 * well to a finer grained ranges:
 *
 *       BUCKETS                             BUCKETS
 *      [ 00-10 ] -> size(Seg0) = 11   ==>  [ 00-10 ] -> size(Seg0) = 11
 *      [ 11-76 ] -> size(Seg1) = 16        [ 11-36 ] -> size(Seg1) = 9
 *                                          [ 37-76 ] -> size(Seg2) = 7
 *
 * EXTENDING BUCKET
 * ----------------
 * In the example above, the reason it wasn't split evenly is that Seg1 must have
 * been holding items with same TTL and they must reside together in the same
 * bucket after the split. Which brings us to another important point. If there
 * is a segment that reached its maximum capacity and all the items have same
 * expiration-time key, then we cannot split the bucket but aggregate all the
 * items, with same expiration time key, by allocating an extended-segment and
 * chain it to the first segment in visited bucket. In that sense, extended
 * segments will only hold items with same expiration-time key.
 *
 *       BUCKETS                            BUCKETS
 *      [ 00-10 ] -> size(Seg0)=11   ==>   [ 00-10 ] -> size(Seg0)=11
 *      [ 11-12 ] -> size(Seg1)=16         [ 11-12 ] -> size(Seg1)=1 -> size(Seg2)=16
 *
 * LIMITING RAX TREE DEPTH
 * -----------------------
 * The rax tree is basically a B-tree and its depth is bounded by the sizeof of
 * the key. Holding 6 bytes for expiration-time key is more than enough to represent
 * unix-time in msec, and in turn the depth of the tree is limited to 6 levels.
 * At a first glance it might look sufficient but we need take into consideration
 * the heavyweight maintenance and traversal of each node in the B-tree.
 *
 * And so, we can further prune the tree such that holding keys with msec precision
 * in the tree doesn't bring with it much value. The active-expiration operation can
 * live with deletion of expired items, say, older than 1 sec, which means the size
 * of time-expiration keys to the rax tree become no more than ~4.5 bytes and we
 * also get rid of the "noisy" bits which most probably will cause to yet another
 * branching and modification of the rax tree in case of items with time-expiration
 * difference of less than 1 second. The lazy expiration will still be precise and
 * without compromise on accuracy because the exact expiration-time is kept
 * attached as well to each item, in `ExpireMeta`, and each traversal of item with
 * expiration will behave as expected down to the msec. Take care to configure
 * `EB_BUCKET_KEY_PRECISION` according to your needs.
 *
 * EBUCKET KEY
 * -----------
 * Taking into account configured value of `EB_BUCKET_KEY_PRECISION`, two items
 * with expiration-time t1 and t2 will be considered to have the same key in the
 * rax-tree/buckets if and only if:
 *
 *              EB_BUCKET_KEY(t1) == EB_BUCKET_KEY(t2)
 *
 * EBUCKETS CREATION
 * -----------------
 * To avoid the cost of allocating rax data-structure for only few elements,
 * ebuckets will start as a simple linked-list and only when it reaches some
 * threshold, it will be converted to rax.
 *
 * TODO
 * ----
 * - ebRemove() optimize to merge small segments into one segment.
 * - ebAdd() Fix pathological case of cascade addition of items into rax such
 *   that their values are smaller/bigger than visited extended-segment which ends
 *   up with multiple segments with a single item in each segment.

 * with similar expiration-time will be aggregated into the same bucket. The lower
 * the value, the more "accurate" the active expiration of buckets will be.
 *
 * Note that the accurate time expiration of each item is preserved anyway and
 * enforced by lazy expiration. It only impacts the active expiration that will
 * be able to work on buckets older than (1<<EB_BUCKET_KEY_PRECISION) msec ago.

 * will work only on buckets that already got expired at least 1sec ago.
