Welcome to Redis 2.0.5

This release fixes an important bug related to a file descriptor leak with
AOF enabled.

We strongly suggest upgrading to Redis 2.2.x ASAP to all the 2.0.x users!

Cheers,
Salvatore

Welcome to Redis 2.0.4

This release fixes two non critical bugs:

    - HMGET used to crash when called against a key that was not holding
      an hash. Fixed by Pieter Noordhuis.
    
    - Redis will now not try to save the DB if no save points for RDB are
      configured, when used as a non persistent cache. Thanks to Robey
      Pointer from Twitter for providing this patch.

Waiting 2.2 ...

Welcome to Redis 2.0.3

This release fixes two important bugs:

    - The maxmemory directive was broken in Redis <= 2.0.2, since from time to
      time it replayed with an error about memory limit reached even when
      it was possible to expire some volatile key to make room for new data.

      The new behaviour is the correct one of always allowing write operations
      to succeed as long as there are other volatile keys to remove.

    - An AOF bug related to blocking POP could crash Redis on AOF reload.
      This is now fixed thanks to Pieter Noordhuis and a kind user that
      helped us on IRC.

Enjoy!
Salvatore

Welcome to Redis 2.0.2

This is a bugfix release, with the followign changes:

    - Fixed a bug that may slow down significantly (from a few milliseconds
      to many seconds) server side intersections when a background write is
      in progress. This was due to the hash table resize policy, prevented when
      there was a saving child. Now it's prevented only up to 5 times
      overbooking, so we try hard to prevent a lot of copy on write, but
      avoiding to trigger pathological hash table performances of O(N) instead
      of O(1).
    - Fixed expired keys counter in INFO output. It was not counting keys
      force-expired due to max-memory limit reached.

Ciao,
Salvatore

Welcome to Redis 2.0.1

This is a bugfix release, with the following changes:

    - Fixed a not critical but important VM bug: from time to time a race
      condition may happen and a client may never get the reply from a given
      request.
    - Now we have a make install target as stated in the README
    - redis-cli no longer tries to understand if it's part of a pipe
      so there is to use the -x option to read the last arg from stdin.
      This prevents it from creating problem when running inside cron scripts.
    - Fixed the init script provided in the tar.gz. It was totally broken.
    - Fixed a bug related to connecting more than 10k clients to Redis.

Good hacking,
Salvatore

Welcome to Redis 2.0.0

Finally we reached 2.0.0 stable!

This is just RC4 with (many) bug fixes applied.
Also this release features an updated redis-cli, backported from master.

Many thanks to VMware, Pieter Noordhuis and the Redis community for making
this possible.

Enjoy!

Welcome to Redis 1.3.17 (2.0.0 RC4)

Compared to RC3 this one contains only an important replication related bugfix
about calls to ZINTERSTORE. Replication users are strongly encouraged to
upgrade ASAP!

If no new bugs will be found in a few weeks this is likely to become
2.0.0 stable in short time (one or two weeks).

Regards,
Salvatore
