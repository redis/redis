Hello! This file is just a placeholder, since this is the "unstable" branch
of Redis, the place where all the development happens.

There is no release notes for this branch, it gets forked into another branch
every time there is a partial feature freeze in order to eventually create
a new stable release.

Usually "unstable" is stable enough for you to use it in development environments
however you should never use it in production environments. It is possible
to download the latest stable release here:

Happy hacking!
