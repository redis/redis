Redis 4.0 release notes
=======================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upgrade urgency levels:

LOW:      No need to upgrade unless there are new features you want to use.
MODERATE: Program an upgrade of the server, but it's not urgent.
HIGH:     There is a critical bug that may affect a subset of users. Upgrade!
CRITICAL: There is a critical bug affecting MOST USERS. Upgrade ASAP.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

================================================================================
Redis 4.0.0-RC2     Released Tue Dec 06 09:25:35 CET 2016
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency LOW: This release mainly fixes a rare GEO API bug and a crash
                     related to the modules subsystem.

Redis 4.0.0-RC2 (version number 3.9.102) just fixes two bugs:

1. GEORADIUS could fail reporting items with very big radius lengths because
   of a bug in the bounding box computation function. This was fixed and tests
   with large radius sizes were added.

2. There was a crash in the modules subsystem that was not merged into RC1 for
   an error, while it was already fixed into the "unstable" branch.

Redis 4.0.0-RC1   Released Fri Dec 2 10:40:01 CEST 2016
================================================================================

Redis 4.0.0-RC1 (version number 3.9.101) is the first release candidate of
Redis 4.0. It is not a production quality release but all the major features
received some testing at this point, the release in feature freeze excluding
things that are considered in the middle ground between fixes and improvements.

Redis 4.0 is not called 3.4 because it is a major release that adds a number
of important and non trivial features. Many core functionalities of Redis were
seriously reworked. In the next release candidates, with your help, we'll gain
informations about the stability level of this release and will produce a new
RC every 2-4 weeks. When the entity and frequency of bug reports will slow down
under a certain level, Redis 4.0 final will be released.

As usually, certain changes to Cluster and Sentinel may not follow the Redis
release cycle and could be incorporated into Redis 4.0 at RC stage or even
after the final version, every time the changes are considered to benefit
the user base enough to be worth incorporating them ASAP without waiting
for Redis 4.2.

So, what's new in Redis 4.0?

Major features
---

* Redis modules system. Redis now allows developers to write modules that can extend the Redis functionalities and implement new data types. The module API implements a complete abstraction layer that separates the Redis core from the module implementation, allowing the same module to be loaded by different versions of Redis without modifications. See the modules documentation here for more info: https://github.com/antirez/redis/blob/unstable/src/modules/INTRO.md

* Partial Replication (PSYNC) version 2. The replication protocol was enhanced (in a backward compatible way, so that 4.0 can still act as a slave of older instances) in order to be able to partially resynchronize slaves and masters in conditions where it was impossible in the past: after a master switch because of a failover and when a slave instance is restared. Even masters turned into slaves will usually be able to partially resynchronize with the new master, if the new master was a former slave of the old master instance. The way the replication work for chained slaves (sub-slaves) is now very different, and each slave receives the same replication stream generated by the top-level master.

* Cache eviction improvements. Redis 4.0 implements LFU (Least Frequently Used) as a new eviction algorithm, and improves the functionality, performances and precision of the existing algorithms. This blog post contains info about the changes: http://antirez.com/news/109

* Lazy freeing of keys. Redis is now able to delete keys in the background in a different thread without blocking the server. The new `UNLINK` command is the same as `DEL` but working in a non blocking way. Similarly an `ASYNC` option was added to `FLUSHALL` and `FLUSHDB` in order to let the entire dataset or a single database to be freed asynchronously.

* Mixed RDB-AOF format. If enabled the new format is used when rewriting the AOF file: the rewrite uses the more compact and faster to generate RDB format, and an AOF stream is appended to the file. This allows faster rewrites and reloads when using the AOF persistence.

* A new MEMORY command, able to perform memory analysis of different kinds: troubleshooting of memory issues (with MEMORY DOCTOR, similar to LATENCY DOCTOR), reporting of the amount of memory used by a single key, more in-depth reporting of Redis memory usage compared to what the INFO command offers.

* Redis Cluster support for NAT / Docker. There are new functionalities in order to force cluster instances to announce specific sets of IP address, client and bus ports, to the rest of the cluster, regardless of the auto detected IP. This required a bus protocol change that will force users to mass-restart all the nodes of a Redis 3.2 installation in order to upgrade to 4.0.

* Redis uses now less memory in order to store the same amount of data. The gain depends a lot on the kind of dataset stored.

* Redis is now able to defragment the used memory and reclaim space incrementally
while running. See the example `redis.conf` for more information.

Smaller features
---

* Improvements to the RDB format to support 64 bit lengths, binary sorted set scores, and more. The RDB file check utility now uses the same code base of the one used by Redis itself in order to load the RDB file in memory.

* SWAPDB command: ability to completely and immediately (no latency) replace two Redis databases.

* Improvements to `dict.c`, the Redis hash table implementation.

* Security improvements mapping POST and Host: commands to QUIT in order to prevent cross protocol scripting attacks.

* RPUSHX and LPUSHX now accept a variable number of elements.

* Reporting of additional memory used by copy on write in the INFO output.

* Serious refactoring of many core parts of Redis.

Migrating from 3.2 to 4.0
=========================

Redis 3.2 is mostly a strict subset of 4.0, you should not have any problem
upgrading your application from 3.2 to 4.0. However this is a list of small
non-backward compatible changes introduced in the 4.0 release:

* Writable slaves do not propagate writes to their sub-slaves, so writes to
  writable slaves remain just local.

* The RDB format changed. Redis 4.0 is still able to read 3.2 (and all the
  past versions) files, but not the other way around.

* Certain log formats and sentences are different in Redis 4.0.

* Certain INFO fields, especially related to replication, are now different.

* GEODIST, GEOPOS and GEOHASH return values changed for non existing keys:
  Previously the return value was inconsistent between non existing key
  and non existing elements. Now the return is always like if the key
  contains no elements if the key does not exist. So, for instance,
  "GEOHASH non_existing_key A B C" now returns an array of 3 NULL values
  as it should. In general this change should not break compatibility with
  the past since in the past two different forms were provided by the server
  and the new behavior is one of the two.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Credits: For each release, a list of changes with the relative author is
provided. Where not specified the implementation and design is done by
Salvatore Sanfilippo. Thanks to Redis Labs for making all this possible.
Also many thanks to all the other contributors and the amazing community
we have.

Commit messages may contain additional credits.

Enjoy,
