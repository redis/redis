Redis 4.0 release notes
=======================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upgrade urgency levels:

LOW:      No need to upgrade unless there are new features you want to use.
MODERATE: Program an upgrade of the server, but it's not urgent.
HIGH:     There is a critical bug that may affect a subset of users. Upgrade!
CRITICAL: There is a critical bug affecting MOST USERS. Upgrade ASAP.

================================================================================
Redis 4.0.2     Released Thu Sep 21 15:47:53 CEST 2017
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency HIGH: Several potentially critical bugs fixed.

Hello, this release addresses several significant bugs in Redis 4.0:

1. A number of bugs were fixed in the area of PSYNC2 replication in the
specific area of restarting an instance with an RDB file having the
repliacation meta-data to continue without a full resynchronization. The
old code allowed several inconsistencies under certain conditions, like
starting a master with an RDB file generated by a slave, and later using
such master to connect previous slaves having the same replication history.
Because of other bugs, sometimes the replication resulted in a full
synchronization even if actually a partial resynchronization was possible
and so forth. Several commits by different authors fix different bugs here.

2. AOF flush on SHUTDOWN did not cared to really write the AOF buffers
(not in the kernel but in the Redis process memory) to disk before exiting.
Calling SHUTDOWN during traffic resulted into not every operation to be
persisted on disk.

3. The SLOWLOG could reference values inside string objects stored at keys,
creating a race condition during FLUSHALL ASYNC while the DB is reclaimed
in another thread.

There are other smaller bugs addessed in this relase, see the full commit
history below for more information.

A big thank you to all the contributors of this release. Without the
help I received, Redis 4.0 would take a much longer time to mature. It's
a real pleasure to work together with people around the world, while making
Redis better.

Redis 4.0.1     Released Mon Jul 24 15:51:31 CEST 2017
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency MODERATE: A few serious but non critical bugs in the modules
                          subsystem. A rare Redis Cluster crash fixed.
                          Many other minor fixes.

Hi everybody. This is the first patch level release of Redis 4.0, fixing the
obvious last minute issues discovered just after the 4.0.0 GA release, plus
a few other things that were no-brainers. The highlights here in terms
of bug fixing are:

1. Loading two or more modules exporting native data types resulted into the
   inability to reload the RDB file.
2. Crash in modules when calling from Lua scripts module commands that would
   block.
3. A Redis Cluster crash due to mis-handling of the "migrate-to" internal
   flag.
4. Other smaller fixes not worth of a release per se, but nice to add here.

If you upgraded to 4.0 to use modules, definitely a required upgrade.
If you are using Redis Cluster, also a good idea to upgrade.
Otherwise... You can definitely wait for the next one :-)

Cheers,
Salvatore

================================================================================
Redis 4.0.0     Released Fri Jul 14 13:04:44 CEST 2017
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: 4.0.0 GA fixes many important bugs.

Dear Redis users,

this is the first stable version of Redis 4.0. There are a number
of bug fixes and improvements compared to the previous RC, mainly:

* Different replication fixes to PSYNC2, the new 4.0 replication engine.
* Modules thread safe contexts were introduced. They are an experimental API right now, but the API is considered to be stable and usable when needed.
* SLOWLOG now logs the offending client name and address. Note that this is a backward compatibility breakage in case old code assumes that the slowlog entry is composed of exactly three entries.
* The modules native data types RDB format changed.
* The AOF check utility is now able to deal with RDB preambles.
* GEORADIUS_RO and GEORADIUSBYMEMBER_RO variants, not supporting the STORE option, were added in order to allow read-only scaling of such queries.
* HSET is now variadic, and HMSET is considered deprecated (but will be supported for years to come). Please use HSET in new code.
* GEORADIUS huge radius (>= ~6000 km) corner cases fixed, certain elements near the edges were not returned.
* DEBUG DIGEST modules API added.
* HyperLogLog commands no longer crash on certain input (non HLL) strings.
* Fixed SLAVEOF inside MULTI/EXEC blocks.
* Many other minor bug fixes and improvements.

Note that 4.0 is probably one of the most extreme releases of Redis ever
made in terms of changes inside the internals: all the aggregated data types
no longer use Redis Objects structures but directly SDS objects, certain
deletion operations are now threaded, the replication engine was modified
in many ways. So please handle this release with care. A few patch-level 
releases will follow in the next weeks and months fixing the important issues
discovered by the users.

You can read the new set of features below in this file, there are a lot
of improvements that can make a real difference in real world use cases.
Also note that Redis 4.0 is, as usually, almost a perfect superset of Redis
3.2, so it is very rare that compatibility with the past is broken in terms
of exported commands.

IMPORTANT: Redis Cluster users, please note that, as specified in the list
of incompatibilities, Redis 4.0 cluster bus protocol is not compatible with
Redis 3.2, so in order to upgrade, a mass reboot of the instances is needed
and rolling upgrades are not possible. This change was needed in order to
add compatibility for Containers/NAT, where the bus port at a fixed offset
was not an acceptable design, so we had to change many things, resulting
in the incompatible protocol.

Have fun with Redis 4.0!
Salvatore

================================================================================
Redis 4.0-RC3     Released Sat Apr 22 11:19:56 CEST 2017
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency HIGH: Many bugs fixed and many improvements operated, so who
                      is using 4.0 RC2 should upgrade if possible, or at least
                      should carefully read this release notes to understand if
                      it may be affected by some bug.

Redis 3.9.103 (4.0 RC3 for the friends) is finally out, and the list of commits
is pretty long, so here is a synopsis of all the major changes operated in this
release.

Major things:

* Finally the infamous leakage of keys with an expire, in slaves that are
  configured as writable, is fixed. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* A serious MIGRATE issue forgetting to store the TTL of the key under
  certain conditions is fixed. (reported by Jinbei Wang, fixed by Jan-Erik
  Rediger).
* An in-depth investigation of the ziplist implementation was performed.
  The final result was:
  1. An in depth auditing (Salvatore Sanfilippo and Oran Agra).
  2. The discovery of a bug and its fix (Salvatore Sanfilippo).
  3. The creation of a new specification to replace ziplists with something
     better, listpacks: https://gist.github.com/antirez/66ffab20190ece8a7485bd9accfbc175 (Yuval Inbar, Salvatore Sanfilippo, Oran Agra).
  4. Refactoring and function to dump a ziplist for debugging purposes
     (Salvatore Sanfilippo).
* New major feature: Memory de-fragmentation. This feature, contributed by
  Oran Agra, allows Redis to perform "online defragmentation" of memory
  if the Jemalloc allocator is used. There is some documentation in the
  example `redis.conf` file. (Oran Agra)
* Support for ARM. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* Fix a very important "family of bugs" about PSYNC2, thanks to the help
  of Kevin McGehee, Siran Yang and Oran Agra.
* Hash function moved to SipHash 1-2 variant. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* Redis Cluster failure detection improved in different ways, the most
  important result is to exchange a lot less messages among nodes. (Salvatore
  Sanfilippo)

All the rest:

* A bug in the modules API ziplist iterator was fixed. (Dvir Volk).
* The HyperLogLog implementation final cardinality approximation function
  was improved to use the LogLog-Beta algorithm. (Harish Murthy and
  Salvatore Sanfilippo).
* Edge case copy-on-write disaster fix (Oran Agra).
* Now the Redis ASCII art logo is shown only if logging to stdout and if the
  stdout is a tty. (Salvatore Sanfilippo because of users request).
* A new GEO bug fixed (and there is another pending when huge radiuses are
  used, where elements at the edge may be miss-reported). (Salvatore
  Sanfilippo). ***IMPORTANT*** See the list of incompatibilities below
  since the GEO API has some potentially backward incompatible change.
* ZADD crash on syntax error fixed. (Itamar Haber)
* Fixed a division by zero but in MEMORY DOCTOR. (Jan-Erik Rediger)
* More MIGRATE bugs fixed. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* Different file descriptors potential lakes fixed. (multiple authors)
* Support for Solaris improved. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* Improve memory reclaiming in freeMemoryIfNeeded(). (Oran Agra and
  Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* Fixes multiple bugs in the test suite. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* Fix asynchronous commands in modules API. (Dvir Volk and Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* A new data structure, the radix tree (rax.c) was introduced into Redis in
  order to fix a major Redis Cluster slowdown. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* Fix `lua-time-limit` config ignored in `redis.conf`. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
* Jemalloc downgraded to an apparently safe version, given that recent
  releases apparently hang under certain conditions. See Redis issue #3799.

================================================================================
Redis 4.0.0-RC2     Released Tue Dec 06 09:25:35 CET 2016
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency LOW: This release mainly fixes a rare GEO API bug and a crash
                     related to the modules subsystem.

Redis 4.0.0-RC2 (version number 3.9.102) just fixes two bugs:

1. GEORADIUS could fail reporting items with very big radius lengths because
   of a bug in the bounding box computation function. This was fixed and tests
   with large radius sizes were added.

2. There was a crash in the modules subsystem that was not merged into RC1 for
   an error, while it was already fixed into the "unstable" branch.

The list of commits follows:

================================================================================
Redis 4.0.0-RC1   Released Fri Dec 2 10:40:01 CEST 2016
================================================================================

Redis 4.0.0-RC1 (version number 3.9.101) is the first release candidate of
Redis 4.0. It is not a production quality release but all the major features
received some testing at this point, the release in feature freeze excluding
things that are considered in the middle ground between fixes and improvements.

Redis 4.0 is not called 3.4 because it is a major release that adds a number
of important and non trivial features. Many core functionalities of Redis were
seriously reworked. In the next release candidates, with your help, we'll gain
informations about the stability level of this release and will produce a new
RC every 2-4 weeks. When the entity and frequency of bug reports will slow down
under a certain level, Redis 4.0 final will be released.

As usually, certain changes to Cluster and Sentinel may not follow the Redis
release cycle and could be incorporated into Redis 4.0 at RC stage or even
after the final version, every time the changes are considered to benefit
the user base enough to be worth incorporating them ASAP without waiting
for Redis 4.2.

So, what's new in Redis 4.0?

Major features
---

* Redis modules system. Redis now allows developers to write modules that can extend the Redis functionalities and implement new data types. The module API implements a complete abstraction layer that separates the Redis core from the module implementation, allowing the same module to be loaded by different versions of Redis without modifications. See the modules documentation here for more info: https://github.com/antirez/redis/blob/unstable/src/modules/INTRO.md

* Partial Replication (PSYNC) version 2. The replication protocol was enhanced (in a backward compatible way, so that 4.0 can still act as a slave of older instances) in order to be able to partially resynchronize slaves and masters in conditions where it was impossible in the past: after a master switch because of a failover and when a slave instance is restared. Even masters turned into slaves will usually be able to partially resynchronize with the new master, if the new master was a former slave of the old master instance. The way the replication work for chained slaves (sub-slaves) is now very different, and each slave receives the same replication stream generated by the top-level master.

* Cache eviction improvements. Redis 4.0 implements LFU (Least Frequently Used) as a new eviction algorithm, and improves the functionality, performances and precision of the existing algorithms. This blog post contains info about the changes: http://antirez.com/news/109

* Lazy freeing of keys. Redis is now able to delete keys in the background in a different thread without blocking the server. The new `UNLINK` command is the same as `DEL` but working in a non blocking way. Similarly an `ASYNC` option was added to `FLUSHALL` and `FLUSHDB` in order to let the entire dataset or a single database to be freed asynchronously.

* Mixed RDB-AOF format. If enabled the new format is used when rewriting the AOF file: the rewrite uses the more compact and faster to generate RDB format, and an AOF stream is appended to the file. This allows faster rewrites and reloads when using the AOF persistence.

* A new MEMORY command, able to perform memory analysis of different kinds: troubleshooting of memory issues (with MEMORY DOCTOR, similar to LATENCY DOCTOR), reporting of the amount of memory used by a single key, more in-depth reporting of Redis memory usage compared to what the INFO command offers.

* Redis Cluster support for NAT / Docker. There are new functionalities in order to force cluster instances to announce specific sets of IP address, client and bus ports, to the rest of the cluster, regardless of the auto detected IP. This required a bus protocol change that will force users to mass-restart all the nodes of a Redis 3.2 installation in order to upgrade to 4.0.

* Redis uses now less memory in order to store the same amount of data. The gain depends a lot on the kind of dataset stored.

* Redis is now able to defragment the used memory and reclaim space incrementally
while running. See the example `redis.conf` for more information.

Smaller features
---

* Improvements to the RDB format to support 64 bit lengths, binary sorted set scores, and more. The RDB file check utility now uses the same code base of the one used by Redis itself in order to load the RDB file in memory.

* SWAPDB command: ability to completely and immediately (no latency) replace two Redis databases.

* Improvements to `dict.c`, the Redis hash table implementation.

* Security improvements mapping POST and Host: commands to QUIT in order to prevent cross protocol scripting attacks.

* RPUSHX and LPUSHX now accept a variable number of elements.

* Reporting of additional memory used by copy on write in the INFO output.

* Serious refactoring of many core parts of Redis.

Migrating from 3.2 to 4.0
=========================

Redis 3.2 is mostly a strict subset of 4.0, you should not have any problem
upgrading your application from 3.2 to 4.0. However this is a list of small
non-backward compatible changes introduced in the 4.0 release:

* The Redis Cluster bus protocol of 4.0 is no longer compatible with Redis 3.2.
  This was needed in order to provide Docker / NAT compatibility to Redis
  Cluster. SO in order to upgrade a Redis Cluster to 4.0, a mass restart of
  all the instances is needed.

* Redis Cluster CLUSTER NODES output is now slightly different. Nodes
  addresses are now in the form host:port@bus-port instead of host:port.
  Clients should use CLUSTER SLOTS in order to fetch the cluster configuration
  however if they are still using CLUSTER NODES, they should be modified in
  order to ignore the @bus-port part.

* Writable slaves do not propagate writes to their sub-slaves, so writes to
  writable slaves remain just local.

* The RDB format changed. Redis 4.0 is still able to read 3.2 (and all the
  past versions) files, but not the other way around.

* Certain log formats and sentences are different in Redis 4.0.

* Certain INFO fields, especially related to replication, are now different.

* GEODIST, GEOPOS and GEOHASH return values changed for non existing keys:
  Previously the return value was inconsistent between non existing key
  and non existing elements. Now the return is always like if the key
  contains no elements if the key does not exist. So, for instance,
  "GEOHASH non_existing_key A B C" now returns an array of 3 NULL values
  as it should. In general this change should not break compatibility with
  the past since in the past two different forms were provided by the server
  and the new behavior is one of the two.

* The SLOWLOG command entires contain additional two fields: the client address
  and name. This is documented in the SLOWLOG command online documentation.
