# Redis fuzzing

This directory contains opt-in libFuzzer targets for Redis core. The targets
exercise Redis string, string-backed bitmap, and Array commands through the real
command parser and executor, using a local socketpair-backed client.

The Array target generates bounded, stateful command sequences. It covers
contiguous and sparse writes, sparse-to-dense slice transitions, range deletion,
ring resize and wraparound, cursor movement, scanning, textual search,
reductions, wrong types, boundary indices, and malformed command shapes.

## Build

```sh
make fuzz CC=clang
```

The fuzz build uses libFuzzer with AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer
and forces `MALLOC=libc`, matching Redis sanitizer builds. Normal Redis builds are
unchanged.

## Seed corpora

The checked-in seed files are binary inputs for the command generators, not RESP
payloads. Regenerate them with:

```sh
fuzz/generate-seeds.sh
```

## Run corpus smoke tests

```sh
fuzz/fuzz_string_commands fuzz/corpus/string_commands -runs=1
fuzz/fuzz_bitmap_commands fuzz/corpus/bitmap_commands -runs=1
fuzz/fuzz_array_commands fuzz/corpus/array_commands -runs=1
```

## Run a short campaign

```sh
fuzz/fuzz_string_commands fuzz/corpus/string_commands -max_total_time=300
fuzz/fuzz_bitmap_commands fuzz/corpus/bitmap_commands -max_total_time=300
fuzz/fuzz_array_commands fuzz/corpus/array_commands -max_total_time=300
```

## Reproduce a crash

```sh
fuzz/fuzz_bitmap_commands crash-1234
fuzz/fuzz_bitmap_commands -minimize_crash=1 crash-1234
```

Minimized crash inputs should be added to the relevant corpus directory. If a
crash captures an important semantic regression, add a deterministic Redis test
for it as well.
