To compile Redis, do the following:

    cd src; make

The compilation will produce a redis-server binary.

To install Redis, use

    make install

and all the binaries will be installed on /usr/local/bin.

Alternatively:

    make install PREFIX=/some/other/directory

to have the binaries in /some/other/directory/bin.

Run the server using the following command line:

    /path/to/redis-server

This will start a Redis server with the default configuration.

Otherwise if you want to provide your configuration use:

    /path/to/redis-server /path/to/redis.conf

You can find an example redis.conf file in the root directory
of this source distribution.
