2009-10-30 Initial implementation of append-only mode. Loading still not implemented.
2009-10-30 EXPIRE behaviour changed a bit, a negative TTL or an EXPIREAT with unix time in the past will now delete the key. It seems saner to me than doing nothing.

2009-10-02 Issue 69 fixed. Object integer encoding now works with replication and MONITORing again.
2009-09-18 LREM fixed, used to crash since the new object integer encoding is on the stage
2009-09-17 maxmemory didn't worked in 64 systems for values > 4GB since it used to be an unsigned int. Fixed

2009-07-04 Applied three different patches thanks to Chris Lamb, one to fix compilation and get the IP register value on Linux IA64 and other systems.
