2010-05-13 feed SETEX as SET and EXPIREAT to AOF (Pieter Noordhuis)
2010-05-13 very strong speedup in saving time performance when there are many integers in the dataset. Instead of decoding the object before to pass them to the rdbSaveObject layer we check asap if the object is integer encoded and can be written on disk as an integer. (antirez)

2010-05-11 load objects encoded from disk directly without useless conversion (antirez)
2010-05-11 fixed a problem leading to crashes, as keys can't be currently specially encoded, so we can't encode integers at object loading time... For now this can be fixed passing a few flags, or later can be fixed allowing encoded keys as well (antirez)
2010-05-11 long long to string conversion speedup applied in other places as well. Still the code has bugs, fixing right now... (antirez)
2010-05-11 hand written code to turn a long long into a string -> very big speed win (antirez)

2010-05-06 hincrby should report an error when called against a hash key that doesn't contain an integer (Pieter Noordhuis)
2010-05-06 AOF writes are now accumulated into a buffer and flushed into disk just before re-entering the event loop. A lot less writes but still this guarantees that AOF is written before the client gets a positive reply about a write operation, as no reply is trasnmitted before re-entering into the event loop. (antirez)
2010-05-06 clarified a few messages in redis.conf (antirez)
