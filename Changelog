2010-02-07 WITHSCORES in ZRANGEBYSCORE thanks to Sam Hendley
2010-02-06 Added "withscores" option to zrangebyscore command. Based on withscores support in zrange function, ugliest part was the argument parsing to handle using it with the limit option.

2010-01-21 Changelog updated
2010-01-21 REDIS_MAX_COMPLETED_JOBS_PROCESSED is now in percentage, not number of jobs. Moved a debugging message a few lines forward as it was called where a few logged parameters where invalid, leading to a crash
2010-01-20 fixed a deadlock caused by too much finished processes in queue so that I/O clients writing to the wirte side of the pipe used to awake the main thread where blocking. Then a BGSAVE started waiting for the last active thread to finish, condition impossible because all the I/O threads where blocking on threads. Takes this as a note to myself...
2010-01-20 ae.c event loop does no longer support exception notifications, as they are fully pointless. Also a theoretical bug that never happens in practice fixed.
2010-01-19 commercial tools stuff removed from the Redis makefile. cotools are now migrated into a different repos

2010-01-15 removed a few races from threaded VM
2010-01-14 Fixed a never experienced, theoretical bug that can actually happen in practice. Basically when a thread is working on a I/O Job we need to wait it to finish before to cancel the Job in vmCancelThreadedIOJob(), otherwise the thread may mess with an object that is being manipulated by the main thread as well.
2010-01-14 Set the new threads stack size to a LZF friendly amount
2010-01-13 access to already freed job structure fixed by statements reoredering
